CHAPTER NINE
The drizzle gave way to a sheet of rain which thundered on the hull of the Princess Cecile and lashed the surface of Bay Ten, the ready slip to which the corvette had been transferred at the completion of her refit. Lightning pulsed continuously, backlighting the thunderheads without ever striking in the cone of Daniel's vision through the open main hatch.
Hogg muttered, though he didn't sound especially unhappy about it. The rain was blasting itself to mist on the canopy over the walkway from the edge of the pool to the corvette. Watching it, Daniel could imagine he was in one of the metal-roofed hunting cabins deep in the interior of Bantry&#151;
Instead of waiting for the arrival of the courier whom the Navy Office had an hour ago alerted them to expect.
Apparently thinking in the same track, Ellie Woetjans said, There was a chorus of, and from the half dozen spacers in the the Princess Cecile's entranceway.
Woetjans was a rangy, powerful woman who was taller than Daniel by six inches. As bosun she rapped helmets with a length of electrical cord to get the attention of landsmen she was turning into riggers. No need of that with the present crew, of course.
Woetjans was soaking wet, having just come in with the team which had changed out the main hinge of Dorsal 3. The antenna had stuck a few degrees short of closure twice during testing. Daniel had been willing to lift with it&#151;joints loosened in service, after all&#151;but since there were a few minutes unexpectedly available, the bosun had taken five riggers out despite the rain. She hadn't bothered to change when she returned in case the courier with the Princess Cecile's orders arrived during those few moments. The crew was even more excited about the corvette's next deployment than her captain was.
Well, make that as excited. Admiral Anston had called Daniel in personally, after all. He wouldn't have done that if he'd planned to send the Princess Cecile to the Home Squadron protecting Cinnabar against Alliance raiders&#151;who had last attacked some seventeen years ago. There was every chance that Lt. Leary's first operational command would be an independent one.
said Adele's voice through the earphones of the commo helmet Daniel was wearing along with his utility uniform. He should have guessed that Adele would be monitoring not only ordinary communications traffic but also intercepting limited-distribution messages that she and her software thought might be of interest to the Princess Cecile. A truck, though? Why on earth would the courier have a truck with him?
Daniel said, Adele sniffed. she said, not angrily but with enough of an edge to remind Daniel who he'd been talking to. Smiling faintly but tense all the same, Daniel said, loudly enough to be heard by those with him in the entrance. He lifted his equipment belt with his thumbs to settle it more comfortably over his hipbones.
The rain had slackened again, though that was hard to tell because of the water still dripping from the antennas through the flare of the area light above the Princess Cecile's hatch. Headlights swept down the curving roadway toward Bay Ten in Vs of spray. The lead vehicle, illuminated by the following one, was one of the enclosed two-place scooters used by the Navy Office message service.
Adele came down the companionway from C Level and the bridge. Unconsciously her hand brushed the right cargo pocket where her personal data unit rode. She had no need for special tailoring when wearing a utility uniform.
The vehicles pulled up at the shelter for visitors to Bay Ten. A figure in a close-drawn rain cape got out of the scooter and started down the walkway toward the corvette's hatch, hunched over against the weather. The rain was coming down harder again. It wasn't the downpour of minutes earlier, but it still blew under the canopy.
Hogg noticed aloud. Adele frowned, then flipped down the jump seat intended for a sentry at the airlock and took her data unit out. Daniel glanced at her, wondering what in the world she was doing.
The wands flickered. Without looking up Adele said, Daniel opened his mouth to say, But it wasn't certain that they would learn in a moment; and anyway, that probably didn't make any difference to Adele. She had more faith in data that she uncovered herself than she did in what somebody from the Navy Office told her; and thinking about it, Daniel too had more faith in what Adele learned in her own fashion. He swallowed his comment unspoken.
The courier reached the hatch and stepped into the entryway, out of the weather. The trousers of his 2nd Class uniform were darkened several shades from the original dove gray where the rain had soaked them.
the man said, his voice rough. He coughed to clear his throat.
Daniel stepped forward. he said.
The stiffened bill of the courier's cowl shadowed his face. He brought from beneath his cape a packet closed with the Republic's seal, a winged sandal, over an embossed RCN. Daniel broke the seal with his index finger, watching the holographic wings flap three times. If the envelope had been opened before it reached him, the charge would have dissipated whether or not the seal itself were damaged. There was no reason to suspect forgery, but the Matrix makes people&#151;those who survive&#151;careful about details.
He drew out the document and read:
&nbsp;
Navy Office, 16 xi 45
Lt. D. O. Leary,
Comdg. RCS Princess Cecile, Harbor Three.
Lieutenant: So soon as the Republic of Cinnabar corvette which you have been appointed to command shall be in all respects ready for space, you will proceed to the Strymon system, touching at such ports as you may think proper.
If possible you will meet at Sexburga the squadron under Commodore Pettin, already en route to Strymon, and place yourself under his command for the remainder of the cruise. If you do not join Commodore Pettin en route, you will report to him in the Strymon system.
During your presence at Strymon you will do all in your power to cherish, on the part of their government, good feelings toward the Republic of Cinnabar. In addition you will carry out such other duties as are placed on you by competent authorities. You will return to Cinnabar in accordance with the directions of Commodore Pettin.
The courier bearing these orders will provide additional oral instructions which you will carry out as a part of your duties.
You will communicate to all the officers under your command the orders of this Office that no one be concerned in a duel during the course of this cruise.
Commending you and your ship company to the protection of Divine Providence, and wishing you a pleasant cruise and a safe return to your planet and friends, I am,
Very respectfully,
Anston
&nbsp;
Frowning slightly, Daniel handed the dispatch to Adele to read. To the courier he said, The courier undid his cape's throat catch and shrugged the garment off. It fell on the deck behind him. He was Delos Vaughn. He said, Daniel's face didn't change. He said nothing while his mind shuffled through possibilities.
Vaughn continued in the silence; sharply, a little nervous in the face of Daniel's lack of reaction. The others present were taking their cue from Daniel. Apart from Adele, none of them saw anything remarkable in the situation.
Daniel said. He turned, catching Adele's eye. She'd risen to her feet when the courier arrived, but the data unit was still in her hand. She gave a minute shake of her head, her expression guarded.
Vaughn said. Daniel said. The storm had resumed in all its elemental fury. Its thunder and actinic glare were anchors for Daniel's mind, underscoring how trivial human concerns were against the majesty of nature. Vaughn said, momentarily the aristocrat to a servant. Daniel felt his face tighten and grow warm with the blood rising to the skin. he said.
Vaughn said, a gentleman to a peer again, He twisted his head, sketching a gesture toward the vehicles waiting at the poolside.
He beamed at Daniel in open-faced enthusiasm.
Daniel had a sudden vision of himself as a cog in a vast machine which stretched away in all directions. Parts whirring, trembling; wheels and pistons and slides in vibrant motion, and somewhere a control board at which a faceless figure sat. He thought, I am Daniel Leary, officer by grace of God and the will of the Senate. I am not a cog in anyone's machine!&nbsp;
he said aloud. The first leg would be no more than eighteen days or he'd know the reason why!&nbsp;
He nodded to Adele. he said, One of the two small cabins of Daniel's suite off the bridge, intended for entertaining non-RCN guests where they wouldn't have access to a console tied into the corvette's data bank.
He smiled at Vaughn. Adele said with a moue of irritation.
Vaughn said, grinning&#151;to Daniel's surprise&#151;in satisfaction. Aren't you a clever devil? Daniel thought. Trying me on to see if I'd let you have whatever you wanted. A Leary of Bantry kowtowing to a foreigner!&nbsp;
Daniel said aloud. He checked the time on the flat multifunction card he wore on a wrist clip while in utilities, then looked up again. He smiled and felt the thrill of the words as he added, * * *
As the Princess Cecile trembled, white rings became blue solids on the sidebar to Adele's communications display. One at a time, eight of them: the plasma thrusters switching from standby to live, expelling minute streams of white-hot ions into the pool. Very shortly Daniel would slide his linked throttles forward and the thrusters would lift the corvette to transatmospheric orbit.
Adele was detached, unaffected by the tense bustle of the bridge around her. She had duties at this moment, though they were of the negative variety: to block all incoming messages unless they directly concerned the vessel's liftoff. The operation was complex and potentially dangerous if botched, though there was more risk of the sun going dark in the next minutes. Between the time the liftoff sequence began until the Princess Cecile reached orbit, even Admiral Anston could wait.
Betts, the Chief Missileer, and Sun, the gunner's mate&#151;a corvette was too small to rate a master gunner&#151;were taut at their consoles to the left of Adele's, though neither of them had as much to do with the process of liftoff as the Signals Officer did. Woetjans and a team of riggers waited in the corridor. They would climb onto the hull after the Princess Cecile reached an altitude at which the antennas could be deployed. That would be at least ten minutes and might be thirty, but the riggers already wore their suits with the faceplates hinged open.
They were all spacers, feeling a responsibility to the ship and its performance. To Adele, the Princess Cecile was the metal box in which she happened to ride at the moment. She would do her job and whatever else Daniel or another asked of her, but she couldn't even pretend to care whether the ship rose to orbit&#151;as it would, as surely as the sun would rise&#151;or instead exploded here in Harbor Three.
The hatches were closed, the thrusters lighted; the fusion bottle that provided both plasma and auxiliary power was a green sphere in Adele's holographic display, and the High Drive a hollow green-edged bar indicating that the antimatter converter was on standby but fully functional. Adele didn't need to echo the ship's indicators on her screen; she did so merely from a desire to show solidarity with the rest of the crew to whom they were important.
A smile touched the corners of her lips. If the ship blows up here, who will Mistress Sand get to replace me? Not that the answer was of any real consequence to Adele. She just liked information.
Daniel spoke tersely, authoritatively. The console's dynamic suppressor cancelled the sound of the words even a few inches away. Adele could have listened to the conversation on a dedicated line to the power room, but there was no need to. Lt. Leary was receiving oral confirmation from Chief Pasternak of what the instruments showed: the Princess Cecile was ready to lift.
Daniel grinned through his holographic display which was only a haze of light except to the eyes of the person seated at the console. His hand touched a switch and an electronic alarm whistled three times on a rising note. Signal lights pulsed red to orange, warning the crew during times that sound wouldn't carry because the ship was depressurized.
Daniel brought the throttles forward in a smooth motion. The linkage was physical rather than virtual so that the captain had feedback through his own flesh instead of just a gauge to watch.
Adele flexed her fingers, imagining the control wands between them. The trained human body is capable of wonderful subtlety. Unexpected, unwanted, she remembered a boy's face bulging as the bullet from her pistol punched through the bridge of his nose. That had required only a few ounces' pressure, expertly applied by a trigger finger trained in the gallery in the basement of Chatsworth Minor.
The thrusters roared to full power, squeezing Adele down in her seat. It was a gentle pressure; even with the antennas folded at minimum length along the hull and the sails furled tightly to them, a starship wasn't stressed for high accelerations.
Ships covered interstellar distances by entering bubble universes where physical constants differed from those of the sidereal universe, but velocity was conserved during the passage. There was no need of high accelerations when you could leave the universe for one in which distances were logarithmically shorter and the pressure of Casimir radiation drove vessels across light-years in a matter of hours. The High Drive, though very efficient, was needed only for maneuvering over distances too short for the captain to trust her astrogation.
The Princess Cecile bucked and started to yaw. Daniel's hands danced on the throttles. Adele snapped her eyes to her own display. The indicator for the third thruster in the upper bank&#151;starboard&#151;was quivering. It dropped to a hollow gray circle at the same time as the indicator kitty-corner&#151;Port Two&#151;became a white standby circle.
The Princess Cecile steadied. Adele thought she felt a minuscule vibration that hadn't been present before, but she might be imagining a change because her mind knew something had happened.
Her fingers touched a key with the same precision as Daniel had shown in juggling the throttles. Through her helmet Chief Pasternak was shouting, Daniel said calmly. She glanced at him again. His face wore an absent-minded smile as he tweaked a throttle&#151;no longer linked to the other seven&#151;and the vibration smoothed to glassy perfection. Instead of concentrating on his display as Adele expected, Daniel stabbed the public address switch as forcefully as if he were trying to dent the plate beneath his virtual keyboard. Adele smiled: a control was never in doubt when Daniel activated it. He left delicacy for others.
speakers said, the words echoing themselves from the ceiling of every compartment. As Daniel switched off, he saw Adele watching him from the other side of his display. He grinned and made an O from his right thumb and index finger, then went back to his controls.
Adele did the same. Of course Daniel wouldn't forget that the crew would worry&#151;or at least wonder&#151;because the Princess Cecile's thrust had gone ragged. His duty was even more to the personnel than it was to the vessel's hardware.
Spacers shouted to one another. Under normal circumstances only the officers had communications helmets. When ordinary crewmen spoke to one another, they had to make themselves heard over the thrusters. The pulsing thunder muted as the corvette rose through ever-thinner layers of atmosphere, but even in hard vacuum the fabric of the ship shivered in a kind of low moan.
Two crewmen ran along the corridor carrying a rope-handled footlocker between them. They disappeared down the companionway, undeterred by the weight and awkwardness of their burden. Adele hadn't any idea what they were doing, whether it was a problem or simply personal belongings that somebody had forgotten to stow before liftoff.
The whistle called a two-note signal; the emergency lights glowed blue for a moment. Adele remembered the call from when the Princess Cecile left Kostroma: atmospheric density had fallen to the point that the captain could switch power to the High Drive at will.
Daniel engaged the PA system again. he announced in a tone so emotionless as to sound bored. He waited still-faced for five beats of the second hand, backed the throttles to quarter power, and with his right hand threw the toggle that shut off fuel to the plasma thrusters at the same time as it engaged the matter-antimatter power plant.
The Princess Cecile shuddered. A high-pitched keen replaced the tremble of the plasma motors. Any change in acceleration was too subtle for Adele to sense, but she did feel a slight queasiness, familiar from her previous experience.
The High Drive delivered its thrust from a multithroated central port rather than eight&#151;six during most of this liftoff&#151;widely separated plasma nozzles. It was as though the Princess Cecile were balancing her thirteen hundred tons on the point of a needle. The controls kept the corvette aligned by minute changes in the thrust vector. The direction of changed many times a second.
Adele smiled wryly. In this case, the delicate measuring ability of her inner ear was a detriment to her well-being.
On a sudden whim, she filled her display with a holographic image of the planet beneath. The first time she'd left Cinnabar, she'd sat in the passenger lounge and watched her world shrink on the display. She hadn't found it particularly interesting. Being who she was, she'd watched a perfect simulation of the process as soon as she decided to continue her schooling on Blythe.
Fifteen years ago, Adele had expected to return home. More accurately, it had never crossed her mind that she wouldn't return home, much less that her home would cease to exist. Now . . .
Adele turned from the image of a planet, the lines of its continents softened by the blue haze of atmosphere, and looked at the spacers around her. They were intent, ready for an emergency but cheerful nonetheless. Betts and Sun slapped hands in acknowledgment of a successful liftoff, and the riggers joked in the corridor.
Adele laughed aloud. She didn't worry about coming home again this time either.
Because this time she was taking her home with her.
* * *
Daniel rose from his console and stretched, a full-bodied exercise that ended with him leaning backward and bracing his hands on the seatback with a deck sandal locked around the chairpost. Liftoffs&#151;and landings, even more so&#151;were so all-involving that tension drew his muscles up like drying rawhide until the job was complete.
Delos Vaughn walked onto the bridge, smiling pleasantly. He wore a set of fawn coveralls which were utilitarian in cut, though grease stains would show as they didn't against the gray-on-gray mottling of RCN utilities. Over his left breast pocket was a tape with his name in glowing gold letters.
Vaughn said. You have no business on my bridge! Daniel thought. A bracket snapping on liftoff is no more a systems failure than you're an RCN officer!&nbsp;
Daniel said aloud, Turning his attention immediately to his console so that the comment would appear trivial rather than an angry dressing-down, Daniel keyed the Battle Direction Center channel. he said. Mon replied immediately. There was no need to go through full communications protocol on a dedicated line, any more than there was when dealing with one's fellows face-to-face.
Daniel straightened and again glanced around him. Vaughn had retreated into the corridor. He was watching with the bright interest of a bird but was careful not to interfere with the team of riggers preparing to go onto the hull. He must have felt Daniel's glance, for he waved an index finger in friendly greeting.
Daniel said in a carrying voice, As he spoke, Daniel felt a flash of resentment, an uncommon emotion for him. Having a passenger like Vaughn was almost as bad as&#151;indeed, perhaps worse than&#151;carrying a senior officer. He couldn't feel that the Princess Cecile was really his, the way the officer commanding should be able to do. Although now that Daniel analyzed his feelings, he couldn't see why he should react that way to a foreign civilian.
Adele said in pleasant, cultured impropriety. She rose from her console. A valued member of the RCN, Daniel thought, letting the grin reach his lips. RCN officer in the sense that instructors at the Academy would understand it, though . . . that would be going a little far.&nbsp;
Woetjans gave Daniel a thumbs-up. He nodded. The bosun tongued a control in her helmet and the cheery, four-note Riggers Aloft call rang from the PA system as the signal lights pulsed yellow.
Lt. Mon&#151;dark, wiry and professional&#151;was striding down the corridor, dodging obstacles both human and inanimate, mostly equipment stored there for lack of a better place. Daniel nodded to him at the hatchway, said, and slipped past with the ease of long practice.
Adele shifted left when she should have gone right and bounced off Mon's arm, then bumped Daniel from behind. It was amazing that a person with the physical dexterity Adele showed at a console&#151;or with a pistol&#151;could so consistently move in the wrong direction when she had to get from one point in a starship to another.
And of course when she was on a starship it was worse. Daniel reminded himself to attach her safety line personally.
The Bow Dorsal airlock was cycling, sending Woetjans and five riggers onto the hull. Six more crewmen waited to follow the first watch: the initial deployment of antennas and sails employed all the riggers rather than merely the port or starboard watch.
Burridge, one of the waiting riggers, tossed Daniel a suit from the open locker. He slid into it like a body stocking, then glanced at Adele to help her if she was having difficulty.
She wasn't: Dasi and Jonas held Adele by the arms while Burridge pulled the suit over her limbs and torso with as little ceremony or trouble as a cook has stuffing a sausage. From Adele's expression of mild disinterest, the process wasn't one that disturbed her. Vaughn, squeezed against the opposite bulkhead to keep out of the way, watched with a frown.
The light over the airlock glowed green, indicating the outer door was sealed. Dasi, the team's senior man, slammed the crash bar with a gloved hand and led his riggers into the lock. Daniel latched Adele's faceshield, drew her with him into the lock&#151;it would hold a dozen in a pinch, times when speed was more important than comfort&#151;and locked his own shield closed.
The world was silence except for Daniel's own breathing, heavy and echoing until he caught himself and consciously slowed it. He met Adele's eyes through the faceplates of optical-grade moissanite and grinned. She wouldn't be able to see his lips, but the muscles around her eyes crinkled in an answering grin.
The outer lock opened. The first result of air venting into space was that the light went flat: there was no longer a diffracting atmosphere to soften and spread the illumination.
The riggers surged out of the lock, each one going to a predetermined post. Daniel followed, shuffling forward so that one electromagnetic boot was always flat against the steel hull. He kept his right hand on Adele's equipment belt.
The Princess Cecile was spreading her antennas as quickly as the riggers could unlock them from their cradles along the hull. Hydraulic pressure extended and telescoped the masts and yards. Daniel noticed a dozen places where starlight blurred into iridescent fog. Some leakage was inevitable where new gaskets hadn't worked in or old gaskets had worn, and the vacuum of space emphasized the flaws. A trained eye&#151;and Daniel's was&#151;could tell the difference between a trivial seepage and a potential problem.
He leaned to touch his helmet to Adele's. he said, pointing forward toward the second mast on the corvette's port side. Adele turned to follow the line of Daniel's fingers, taking her helmet out of contact with his. Riggers' suits weren't normally fitted with radios. An accidental transmission in the Matrix could have incalculable&#151;literally&#151;effects on a ship's velocity and location in regard to the sidereal universe.
The riggers didn't adjust the sails: hydraulics controlled from the bridge did that. But the pumps, the joints, the parrels&#151;even the gossamer fabric&#151;were machines and worked the way good machines do: most of the time. The riggers patched and stretched and replaced. If an antenna was beyond quick repair they signaled the problem through the hull, using a hydromechanical semaphore with a keyboard for unusually complex problems. The captain and navigation computer could then choose another solution to the astrogation task.
It wasn't a handicap for a trained crew to operate by semaphore and hand signals even while the ship was in normal space. Riggers as experienced as those of the Princess Cecile's present crew could put a ship through her paces with no direction at all. Stiction, leaks, breakage&#151;all were as obvious to the crewmen as they were to Woetjans or Daniel, and they could do the repairs in their sleep.
The riggers didn't need to talk. Daniel needed to be on the hull to talk to Adele without risk of being overheard. For this too the lack of a radio was an advantage, so long as both parties remembered they had to keep their helmets touching to hear one another.
Which Adele now did, a moment late, clanking her head back against Daniel's. He winced, more at the thought than from the shock itself. Riggers' gear had to be able to take a hammering, but the very violence of the environment meant spacers learned to be as gentle as a nurse handling infants.
she said contritely. Adele had the saving grace of knowing she was clumsy on shipboard. The dispatch vessel Aglaia from which most of the Princess Cecile's crew were drawn had often carried high-ranking civilians. Some of them insisted on coming out on the hull but because of pride refused to wear a safety line like the one which joined Adele to Daniel. Woetjans told of leaping between masts to snag a treasury official who was on his way toward Canopus if she hadn't caught him.
Daniel said, holding his friend tight so that she wouldn't absentmindedly pull away. Adele turned to face him, then caught herself and brought her helmet back in contact temple to temple. she said. There was a pause; Daniel knew his friend well enough to visualize her frowning as she chose words with her usual precision. she said, her voice robbed of all overtones by the method of transmission, Daniel didn't know what other duties Adele had to the Republic, but he knew there had to be a connection well above that of the Personnel Bureau in the Navy Office. Her skills made her a marvelous addition to the Princess Cecile's crew, but there was no way in Hell that a faceless clerk would have approved a signals warrant for someone with Adele's deficiencies on paper.
Daniel had been prepared to use what influence he had. The business didn't gain him much ground in the RCN directly, but there were admirals' wives to whom he might seem a romantic figure. All the more so, because young Leary was trying to get his ladyfriend aboard his ship in despite of a hard-hearted bureaucracy.
He might have succeeded, but he hadn't had to try. Adele's warrant whisked through the Navy Office like grass through a goose. It was delivered to the Princess Cecile before the port commander decided which bay the corvette would refit in.
Daniel grinned. Adele was his friend, and she was a lady in every sense of the word; but for romance, Daniel preferred something younger, rounder and, frankly, not so smart. Besides which, so far as Daniel had been able to tell, Adele had no interest in romance whatever.
The sails were stretching the length of the yards. The electrostatic fabric was so thin that bright stars were visible through it. For this initial deployment Mon was running everything out to its maximum extent. The antenna and sail mechanisms had been tested thoroughly on the ground, but vacuum and the vibration of liftoff could expose flaws that would only appear in real service.
Daniel said, speaking more to himself than his companion. A warship's enormous suit of sails spreading to shadow the universe was a sight to move a dead man.
Adele said. A dead man, but not necessarily a librarian. Daniel said aloud. Cinnabar was beneath them as the Princess Cecile rotated slowly on her axis, though that wasn't a sight Daniel would ever have called attention to. Planets were very interesting places&#151;when you were on the ground. From low orbit, they were simply a difficult problem in shiphandling.
Before he left the bridge, Daniel had programmed a rotation to introduce a slight angular strain on the rig. The purpose of a shakedown cruise was to find anything that might have gone wrong during a refit. Daniel appreciated the compliment implied when Admiral Anston ordered the Princess Cecile into operational service immediately, but he still intended to wring out the corvette while he had the leisure of no one shooting at them.
said Adele in turn. She shifted slightly in an obvious attempt to feel what Daniel felt.
The rig had reached its fullest extent; now its elements began to retract to the setting programmed for entry into the Matrix. Masts and yards telescoped, rotating on their axes and occasionally tilting to bring the sails into precise alignment.
Adele said. She'd lowered her voice reflexively so that Daniel could barely make out the words vibrating from her helmet to his. Daniel said, pursing his lips in a look of frustration. He thought of his own interview with Admiral Anston: what he'd been told&#151;virtually nothing&#151;and what he hadn't. The Princess Cecile was about to enter the Matrix: Daniel felt the charge building. He'd never been sure whether it was a real sensation or something his soul recognized. Engineers had sworn to him that a rigger's suit was completely insulated, even if the minute potentials being bled into the sails could be sensed at all.
It happened. The charged fabric of the sails formed a series of precisely calculated barriers against the Casimir radiation that flooded the cosmos. Pressures that could not be relieved in the sidereal universe built up, shifting the Princess Cecile&#151;
Golden light suffused the corvette, throwing her rig and outside crew into silhouette as though against an angel's wing. Daniel shivered with anticipation.
Palpable energy flared. The Princess Cecile slipped from the universe of her creation into the greater glowing infinity that would take her to Strymon . . . under the command of Lt. Daniel Leary.

CHAPTER TEN
Dasi and Barnes had collapsed the wall between the two rooms of the captain's suite, then pegged it down as a central table. The bunks&#151;Daniel's and the one from what had become Adele's cabin&#151;became cushioned benches at the long sides of the table. The arrangement was tight, but not notably worse than any other portion of the corvette's interior.
Daniel beamed at his guests from behind the data console, now reversed at the head of the table. Adele knew that this was the first operational command group meeting Daniel had called as captain, and he was correspondingly proud. Not that Daniel ever did anything with less than enthusiasm.
There was no formal seating order, but Mon sat at the captain's right and the others had by silent consensus granted Adele the seat at Daniel's left. In the middle places were the other watch-standing officers: Pasternak, Woetjans, Betts and the ship's machinist, Taley.
The two midshipmen, Dorst and Vesey, sat in the end seats with big eyes and their lips clamped nervously shut. They were present to educate them, not by right, since they ranked only as petty officers. They'd reported aboard a few hours before the Princess Cecile lifted off: the grandson of an old shipmate of Stacey Bergen, and an intense young woman who'd brought Daniel a curtly phrased introduction from Klemsch, the Secretary to the Navy Board.
Adele had checked their backgrounds, of course. Chances were Vesey was the bastard of Senator Dryer; her record at the Academy was far superior to that of Dorst in any case.
Tovera had put glasses at the places, and Hogg held a tray with a carafe of a respectable Cinnabar sherry. The wine was too fruity for Adele's taste, but she wouldn't have to drink much of it. Open bottles didn't last long, not in a company of naval officers.
Daniel said. said Taley, nodding solemnly&#151;an expression that came naturally to her as she looked as cadaverous as a corpse buried three weeks. Daniel said with a grin. Betts said. The missileer tossed off his sherry and would have retrieved the carafe if Hogg hadn't interposed his hip so that little Vesey could serve herself. said Pasternak tartly, Adele's eyes narrowed slightly. Both officers had gained their experience aboard large vessels operating as part of a fleet.
Woetjans said, knuckling her scarred jaw. Daniel said. He smiled, then shrugged. He nodded to the bosun.
Betts said, his eyes following the carafe.
Daniel said with a sharpness that turned agreement into something just short of a rebuke. Adele took her wine, and Hogg emptied the rest into Daniel's glass. Tovera was filling another carafe; the label was identical, but the fluid within had a mauve undertone that the first bottle hadn't. Daniel wouldn't think of cutting the quality of what his guests drank after they'd had a first glassful to numb their taste, but Hogg wasn't one to pour his master's money down a rathole if he saw other options.
Mon said, frowning as though he'd just been told his legs had to be amputated. Mon had more experience than most with getting bad news, and he'd perfected a suitable expression. The lieutenant glared down the length of the table as if daring anyone to contradict him. There was small chance of that: Mon drank on Kostroma, on Cinnabar, and on shipboard, though Adele had never seen him unable to carry out his duties.
Mon grinned sourly. He raised his glass, just refilled by Hogg. he said.
echoed other officers, the midshipmen the loudest. Daniel quirked a smile but didn't drink that toast; Adele set the personal data unit before her on the table and picked up its wands.
Taley said. Daniel answered mildly. Betts said. Pasternak said. Daniel glanced at Adele. he said.
Adele hadn't been expecting the question, but she'd absently brought up data on the three vessels as Daniel spoke their names. She increased the display's saturation for easier reading, then said, There were seventeen messages from Captain Pettin&#151;Commodore when the squadron lifted off, under his command as senior captain in lieu of an admiral&#151;demanding that the Bureau of Personnel provide him with more spacers. The only response he'd gotten was the MESSAGE RECEIVED notation that the bureau's computer created without the intervention even of a junior clerk.
Woetjans said, looking across the table at Adele. Mon said sadly. Adele said. Daniel said, pursing his lips in careful consideration. Adele repeated. She didn't see why the officers thought it was that complicated a procedure. Any navigational computer had sufficient power to defeat a payroll encryption, and the Princess Cecile&#151;because of Adele's secret assignment&#151;had specialized software besides.
Daniel smiled like the sun rising. He put his left hand on Adele's right and added, Lt. Mon said. There were murmurs of agreement around the table, and possibly an increased sharpness in Tovera's expression also as she decanted more sherry. She felt Adele's eyes and shrugged in embarrassment at showing interest.
Mon was Daniel's senior on the lieutenant's list by eight years, but Adele hadn't seen any sign of resentment toward his youthful commanding officer. She wondered if Mon was smart enough to believe his best route to promotion was to serve under a flashy, fortunate officer like Daniel Leary, or if it was something more basic: loyalty to a man who had treated him well.
Daniel said. He pursed his lips, then grinned engagingly. He frowned. Woetjans said. Of the officers excepting Adele, the bosun had the most experience of Daniel and the least hesitation of asking a straight question. said Pasternak. He spread his hands to fend off reaction to what sounded like an insult when it came out of his mouth. Woetjans said, rasping over the voices of three other officers who were probably about to make the same point. Betts asked. He sounded vaguely tense, as was to be expected from an ordinary space officer who fears he might be involved in high politics. Everyone stared at Daniel. He nodded twice, his mechanism for getting time to organize his thoughts. He looked around the table, deliberately not letting his eyes fall on Adele.
Daniel said, Adele knew that Daniel had distanced the RCN from the passenger in order to keep the crew's morale up; it was a wonder he hadn't said instead of Even so it set her teeth on edge. It was a betrayal of her cherished belief that humans should be citizens of the universe rather than chauvinists for their particular planet or organization.
She grinned. Of course she was now an officer of the RCN, an organization that stood head and shoulders above every other group in the universe.
Daniel said, smiling at the bosun. Woetjans and Pasternak both glanced at Adele, drawing the gaze of the other officers. She said nothing, and Daniel kept his own gaze blandly off her. Woetjans lowered her eyes in embarrassment and muttered, Daniel's expression hardened slightly. he said, Lt. Mon rose to his feet. His glass was full because Hogg had just been by with the fourth carafe.
Mon said. He didn't slur his words, but his voice boomed louder in the small cabin than it might have done a few bottles before. It was silly. It was the kind of emotional gesture that offended Adele's belief that the intellect should dominate in all human endeavors.
But she downed her sherry in a single gulp and cheered with the others.
* * *
called Lt. Mon over the intercom from the Battle Direction Center. Daniel's display already echoed the BDC data, which was identical to that of the main computer. The chance of the systems being out of synch was vanishingly small, and even in that event the smaller BDC computer was more likely to be in error; but spacers lived to retirement age by making every calculation redundant.
Adele said, frowning slightly at her console. She accepted that standard operating procedure required her to verbalize each step of the process, however obvious it might seem to her&#151;however obvious it was, given that Daniel was echoing her display also. She did it, but she was unlikely to ever come to like the process.
Daniel said. He touched the alarm, sending whistle calls and green light across the Princess Cecile's corridors and compartments. On the hull, the semaphore posts&#151;four each at bow and stern, offset from the lines of antennas&#151;flipped their arms out at 90 degrees and 270 degrees to warn the riggers still topside. Normally, but not now, they were already in the air locks.
Daniel pulled the astrogation module's main switch, cutting off the trickle of power that charged the sails. The corvette staggered. When the charge dropped, the bubble universe which the Princess Cecile was crossing squeezed the vessel out as incompatible with its natural order. The potential dropped at various points of the hull and rig at minutely different times. The discontinuity was noticeable, the way a sleeper can be aware of lightning. Delos Vaughn watched intently from the corridor just outside the bridge. When Daniel called general quarters for a position check, Vaughn had as usual been playing cards in the wardroom with the off-duty officers. He lost money consistently, though never in large amounts.
A suspicious man might suspect that a fellow who was as knowledgeable about poker as Vaughn showed himself to be should at least break even. Daniel didn't like to be suspicious. Still, he'd spent his youth among the influences of his father's political maneuvering and the natural world he observed under Hogg's tutelage. In both environments only the strongest could survive without using deception.
Mon's voice reported, a half-tone higher than it had been a moment before. Vaughn's face looked like a skull, and even the RCN officers on the bridge were suddenly taut.
Humans adapted to the Matrix. They could live and work outside the sidereal universe for days at a time and not be fully conscious of the strain&#151;until it stopped. It was wrenching to experience the relief of returning to sidereal space, only to bounce back in seconds to a bubble universe in which what humans thought of as the natural order was an intrusion.
Wrenching for the captain as well, but Daniel was determined to harden his crew and himself to the process. he said. He hit the five-second warning. Then, as the whistle called and red light surged and subsided, he slid the navigation module live again.
Bony fingers clutched his heart; somewhere a man screamed in abject horror. The Princess Cecile rippled into another universe in a wave of golden light.
Nobody spoke for a while, though Daniel could hear heavy breathing over the whirr of electronics and groans as the hull worked. He got his own pulse under control. Impressions flickered in his brain like afterimages of something glimpsed in bright light. He didn't know what they were, but his subconscious insisted they were important.
Adele said in a small voice. She swallowed as if she was trying to keep breakfast down. Betts mumbled through fists clenched against his mouth, He turned his gray face to Daniel and added, Daniel's face hardened, and a fresh jolt of adrenaline quelled the twitchiness of his stomach. The missileer's words were a challenge to his authority.
Daniel said. Betts drew himself up into a proper military posture at his console. he said. Daniel said warmly. Adele was doing something involved at her console; Daniel wondered what. She didn't analyze the star sightings, though they were collected and processed by equipment in the signals officer's charge.
He had a thought and switched on the PA system. Daniel said. As he listened to the electronic echo of his voice, he thought he saw figures with too many legs walk across the corridor and through the wardroom bulkhead. Airlocks cycled. Woetjans had put both watches on the hull in case of trouble during this first touch-and-go; riggers were as likely as anybody else to find the experience disorienting. Now the extra crewmen were reentering the hull, moving with unfamiliar clumsiness.
Adele said, speaking loudly enough to be heard clearly despite continuing to face her holographic display. Sun said in amazement. The gunner's mate had recovered quicker than anyone else on the bridge, but there was a hint of tension in his cheek and jaw muscles too. Adele turned to face the others in the compartment; the display framed her face as though with a multicolored aura. she said with a dry smile that only those who knew her well would recognize. Daniel said in a combination of pride and embarrassment. He didn't want it to sound as though he thought he was the equal of his uncle as an astrogator. Daniel stood and forced himself to stretch; at the moment his body wanted to curl into a ball and hug itself. He keyed the BDC channel and said, Adele said, rising to her feet. She seemed to be fully herself: cool and detached, with her normal pale complexion in place of the green undertone of a few minutes before. Apparently searching out data had been as bracing for her as a month in the country.
Daniel said truthfully, though he was a little surprised.
Of course Adele had a way of surprising him. He hadn't known about the life-cycle analyses of Stacey's ships, and if asked he would've agreed with Betts that quick in-and-outs would wear a hull at a higher rate than the normal practice.
What he did know&#151;and what Adele probably knew also, though he was glad she hadn't broadcast the information to the crew&#151;was that despite his picked crews, Uncle Stacey's commands had abnormally high rates of psychological casualties. Much as Daniel regretted the fact that he was going to lose spacers in the performance of their duty, the Princess Cecile was a warship and they&#151;like him&#151;were members of the RCN.
Daniel offered Adele his arm and walked to the suit closet just off the bridge. The riggers of the port watch had stripped and were going below to their bunks. From the look of their faces, few would be able to sleep. The starboard watch, still on the hull with Woetjans, might well be the lucky ones. As Daniel had noted in Adele and himself, falling into one's duties seemed to lessen the effect of rapid transitions into and out of the Matrix.
Delos Vaughn lay half-conscious on the floor of the wardroom across from the suit locker. Daniel paused; he hadn't wanted to take Vaughn aboard, but nonetheless the fellow was his responsibility. Timmins, the power room crewman Vaughn had hired to look after him aboard, lifted the passenger's shoulders with one arm and brought a tumbler of clear fluid to his lips with the other.
Daniel began.
Vaughn drank reflexively. His eyes flashed open and he spewed the rest of the glassful across the room. Apparently Timmins' idea of a restorative was neat alcohol from the power room hydraulics.
Vaughn said. He didn't sound angry, merely amazed. Daniel said. He crossed his hands behind his back, a way to keep from fidgeting while he waited for something distasteful.
Instead of the expected shouts and threats&#151;vain, of course, but unpleasant regardless&#151;Vaughn managed a weak smile. he said. Using Timmins as a brace, Vaughn got to his feet. he said. &nbsp;

CHAPTER ELEVEN
Adele sat primly in her place, taking her cue from Ellie Woetjans who presided at the head of the table. The senior warrant officers had invited Lt. Leary, Mr. Vaughn, and the two midshipmen to dinner. Adele was tense because she wasn't good at rituals, and this one was both new to her and important. A gaffe here&#151;and formal dinners were always minefields&#151;risked hurting the feelings of her family by adoption.
Balsley, classed as a Mechanic II but in practice the wardroom servant, stood at the hatchway. In a loud voice that made his brushy little mustache wobble he announced, the bosun said, suiting her action to her words.
Adele scrambled to her feet. She was so careful not to overset the chair behind her that she bumped the table with her thighs. As the table was bolted to the deck neither it nor the place settings were affected an iota, but Adele knew she'd have bruises in the morning.
And not for the first time. She was perfectly comfortable in tight spaces. What she didn't like&#151;and couldn't seem to learn&#151;was moving in tight spaces.
Daniel appeared at the door, wearing his dress grays just as his hosts were. Woetjans said. When she spoke formally, her words came out as though so many cuts of a buzz saw.
Daniel said as he entered. He took the seat to Woetjans' right. He winked at Adele beside him.
Vaughn was behind him, wearing a suit of vivid chartreuse and carrying a bottle. he said, offering the bottle to Woetjans. It was brandy, a distillation from Pleasaunce and expensive even within the Alliance. Betts, peering past Adele's shoulder, said, Adele saw Daniel frown slightly. he said. Woetjans nodded and handed the bottle to Hogg, who'd been drafted for the night along with Tovera and Timmins. She looked a trifle wistful, but she wasn't the person to question her captain's orders even when they were delicately phrased.
Adele knew perfectly well that alcohol impeded the physiology of mating, though no doubt a lot of the process was in the mind. It wasn't an area in which she could claim expertise, of course.
The midshipmen entered last, carefully groomed and as stiff as if they expected to be shot. They were both eighteen, just out of the Academy and on their first operational deployment. In a large vessel they would have had as many as a score of other midshipmen to provide fellowship and a degree of concealment. Instead they'd been placed in a small ship with a picked crew and a captain little more than their own age and already famous. Of course they were nervous!
Adele thought of her own entry into the Blythe Academy. Her smile was grim.
She'd been an outsider&#151;of course; she'd been an outsider all her life and perfectly happy about it. Her skills even at age sixteen were beyond those not only of her fellow students but of her instructors and most of the staff of the Academic Collections. She couldn't imagine wanting to fit in with people whom she considered only a short intellectual step above lapdogs.
Dorst and Vesey couldn't tell themselves that. Besides, from what Adele had seen, they were far too nice to consider doing so. For that matter, if Adele had been trained by instructors as able as the Sissies were at their different jobs, she wouldn't have been so sure of her superiority.
Woetjans said. Adele started to sit, then noticed everyone else was waiting till Daniel's trousers touched the cushion. She grimaced. She would learn how to do this, because it mattered to people who mattered to her.
It was strange, and remarkably pleasant, to be around so many people who mattered.
Glasses of water were already at the places. Hogg was filling squat, four-ounce tumblers from the punch bowl on the sideboard. It looked like lemonade, but Adele knew to be cautious even before Tovera, handing the punch around, whispered, Woetjans said, rising. Adele rose with the others and sipped.
There was a choking sound from the end of the table. Dorst's face was very red. He saw the others staring at him and quickly downed another gulp of the punch from the glass he'd half-emptied at the toast.
Daniel nodded approvingly at the lad. Adele supposed that displaying bravado in the face of adversity was a virtue the RCN wanted to inculcate in its young officers. Certainly it was behavior that Daniel himself could be expected to approve.
Hogg was refilling glasses. Tovera set a pitcher of water on the table to Adele's right; the other diners politely pretended not to notice, the way they'd have done if she'd lost both arms and had to eat using her toes. Throughout most of her life Adele had never imagined she'd feel embarrassment at not being able to down the equivalent of eight or ten ounces of absolute alcohol in the course of an evening; but then, she'd never imagined that she'd be an RCN officer, either.
As Balsley took the first course, a tureen of soup, from an undercook at the doorway&#151;hatchway, she had to remember to call it a hatchway&#151;Vaughn said to Daniel across the table, Hogg and Tovera continued to dispense punch, which kept them busier in this company than Balsley and Timmins were serving the food. Adele tasted the soup and found it thick and rather good, albeit bland.
Apart from being overcooked and underseasoned to her taste, formed as it was in sophisticated circles, Adele had been surprised at how good RCN rations were. At the start of a cruise, a vessel's first lieutenant drew and inspected stores from a naval warehouse. The chief of ship and chief of rig&#151;engineer and bosun&#151;then had to give their approval to the lieutenant's assessment.
If the officers protested the quality of the offering, the agent could either provide replacements (which had to be approved in turn) or convene a Navy Office tribunal to decide the matter. Given that two of the tribunal members were by regulation former or serving space officers, very rarely did the warehouse personnel choose to argue the point.
The warehousemen were allowed five percent for their profit. Any more than that, however, required the collusion of a vessel's senior officers. Given the number of ways a fatal accident could occur in space, even the most venal officers would think twice about starving the spacers who might be standing behind them at a steam line, or a hundred and fifty feet above them with a wrench.
Daniel said. From him the statement was no conventional excuse: Adele had first-hand experience of her friend's interest in the whims of nature on various planets. He paused to wash a mouthful of soup down with a hefty swig of punch, then turned to Adele and said, Adele paused to remove with as much delicacy as possible something that hadn't responded well to chewing. A glance into her napkin suggested that it was a piece of plastic container that had been opened with a sharp knife. she said. It couldn't very well have been poisonous, after all. Adele had loaded specialist political and economic data, but . . . She felt her face tighten with cold anger. It was directed at herself, of course, as her anger generally was; but Vaughn, who didn't know her the way Daniel did, flinched back in surprise.
she said. Vaughn said. What Adele saw was that Vaughn had managed to bring most or all of his truckload of luggage aboard the Princess Cecile. A chip library needn't take up much volume, even with a reader, but Vaughn's wardrobe and personal rations hadn't been packed into one and a half cubic feet.
Presumably he'd bribed crewmen to slip his baggage aboard in the rain and conceal it. That couldn't be said to degrade naval discipline&#151;Adele had learned quickly that all spacers were smugglers, as surely as all good librarians were obsessives&#151;nor was the corvette's fighting efficiency degraded if some of her crew members shared their narrow bunks with cases of off-planet finery.
In the initial interview with Vaughn, Daniel had made the point that he'd decide the Princess Cecile's activities without regard for his passenger's wealth or influence. Vaughn had bowed to the captain's authority and achieved his end in a time-honored fashion that put money in the crew's pocket for leave on Sexburga.
Politics in action, as Adele's father might have said. Backdoor compromises, indirection; face-saving gestures. The social lubricants for which Adele Mundy had no taste or aptitude. Data in files were so much easier to deal with.
Daniel said, spooning the last of the soup into his mouth. Vaughn said with a deprecatory lift of his hands. Daniel glanced at Adele and raised an eyebrow. She started to say that, given the ship's communications suite and her own skill, there was no format in the human universe that she wouldn't venture to read. She caught herself an instant before the first syllable left her tongue.
Adele said blandly, Intellectual pride had always been her besetting sin; it had become a danger to her life and work since she accepted Mistress Sand's duties. Vaughn obviously had no idea of how completely open to Adele's perusal any documents he had would be. That ignorance was probably to the benefit of Adele's mission and to the officers and crew of the Princess Cecile.
Daniel said, momentarily surprised but concealing the fact beneath commonplaces. Taley said. She hadn't eaten much of her soup, but she was matching Mon mug and mug with the punch. said Pasternak without raising his eyes from the table. He gave Adele a sidelong glance of acknowledgment.
Woetjans said, staring into her mug with a bleak frown. She swallowed down the contents of her mug, then waggled the fingers of her free hand in the air.
Adele had a bleak vision of a rigger drifting in a bubble universe that had nothing human in it but him&#151;forever. She shivered. Death didn't frighten her, but the thought of that eternal loneliness had a terror for even her gray soul.
They were all looking at Daniel. Adele was suddenly aware of how pale the officers' faces were, how deep-sunk their eyes. The spacers gathered here in the wardroom were among the most experienced in the RCN, but even they were being ground down by Daniel's daily regimen of the Matrix punctuated by heart-freezingly brief returns to the normal universe.
he said softly. Pasternak said. His voice was steady, but his hands trembled until he laced them around his mug. Woetjans said, gripping her glass as if trying to strangle it. Adele felt herself trembling. Without glancing toward her, Daniel covered her right hand with his left and said in a measured voice, He lifted his tumbler to call attention to it. he said. The general laughter as Tovera filled the mug dissolved the mood of a moment before; but though Adele smiled at the humor and the skill with which Daniel used humor for a tool, there was a cold weight in her guts. She thought of the insertions of the next day and the nine days after that&#151;if they lived so long.
And unlike Daniel, she couldn't convince herself that avoiding death was really that valuable a benefit.
* * *
Daniel watched a trio of strangers enter the bridge through the exterior bulkhead, talking in silent animation. They looked perfectly normal&#151;an older man, a boy, and a woman Daniel wouldn't have minded getting to know better&#151;except that they had downy feathers instead of hair.
said Lt. Mon from the BDC. His voice sounded shaky, but that could be a flaw in the communications system . . . or in Daniel's ears. The voyage had been hard, very hard.
Daniel replied, then switched to intercom and said, He could hear faint cheering from other compartments. After seventeen days of discomfort punctuated by agony, nobody had much energy even for that.
Adele stared transfixed at the three phantoms, looking horrified. The remaining bridge personnel kept their attention on their displays.
Daniel said. The older male was making wide, oratorical sweeps of his right arm while his left remained cocked over his chest.
It was all automatic from here on in unless there were an emergency. Betts was setting up missile launches. That had drawn Sun to simulate gunfire targets on his display. Daniel was all for training, but plotting for immediate attack on entry into a major Cinnabar naval base couldn't be called realistic preparation. So far as Daniel was concerned, calming a friend who looked uncomfortable was at least as good a use for his time.
Adele let her breath out slowly and looked at him. she said. he said. Adele said. She looked at the men on the battle consoles and said, The gunner's mate turned and smiled shyly at her. he said. Betts said nothing, utterly engrossed in plotting courses for his missiles. The muscles in Daniel's jaw bunched, then relaxed. The missileer was reacting to the stress of the voyage in his own way. He was no more to be censured than Daniel and Adele were for seeing feather-haired strangers on the bridge.
Adele shook her head in wonder. she asked.
said Daniel. Apparently the range of options was wider than merely seeing a phantom or not.
he said. Mon said, verbalizing the countdown that Daniel's screen showed as a sidebar.
His main display was a navigational tank in three dimensions, the portion of the sidereal universe analogous to the Princess Cecile's location in a wholly separate bubble of the cosmos. A bead of pure cyan drifted across the star map in tiny caracoles like a leaf blowing in the wind. If Daniel were to cut the charge of the sails now, the bead would be the corvette's location; if the astrogational computer was correct.
Abruptly, almost angrily&#151;the voyage had been just as hard on the captain as it had on the rest of the complement&#151;Daniel switched his display to the Princess Cecile's sail plan. Instead of the icons that provided information in the most concentrated form, he rolled the controller up to give him a simulated real-time view of the corvette hanging in space, lighted by a sun like Cinnabar's at a distance of 107 million miles. Color codings on the icons would have told Daniel that the port sails were all set at 37 degrees; that ventral and starboard courses were at 63 degrees; and that the mainsail on Dorsal Three was spread straight fore and aft to serve as a rudder.
Daniel needed a reminder of the reality of the ship about him, the ship he commanded. This image provided it. He didn't care about the precise details, though his trained eye could have called the settings to within a hair's breadth if he'd been out on the hull.
Which is where he wanted to be. Duty kept him aboard.
he said, aloud but not really concerned whether anyone else on the bridge heard him. Betts said, bent over his console; plotting solutions that were as imaginary as the holographic sails on Daniel's display. His missiles were, like Daniel's sails, the anchor that held his mind to&#151;if not sanity, then to the memory of sanity.
said Mon. Again Daniel failed to acknowledge. All that mattered was that the spacers aboard the Princess Cecile each find a way to create reality. Create: because such long immersion in the Matrix proved to every soul aboard that reality wasn't an absolute, that it was no more than the whim of an individual mind for as long as the mind could stay sane.
The time column on the sidebar was shrinking to zero. If Daniel switched back to the navigational display, he would find the cyan bead approaching the pinpoint that was Sexburga. Toward ze&#151;
a voice screamed; maybe Mon's, maybe Daniel's own as his left hand drained the sails' charge and the Princess Cecile shuddered back into normal space, this time to stay.
Nothing changed within the hull, but the light was richer, the fittings had palpable density instead of being gassy umbras, and the air filled Daniel's lungs with the smells of weeks of being lived in. The stench was indescribably wonderful, like the rough texture of a log in the grasp of a man who had been drowning.
The cheers were rough, bestial. The relief the spacers felt came from far below the conscious levels of their minds.
His fingers moving by reflex, Daniel switched his display to a Plot Position Indicator. The icon that stood for the corvette was less than 150,000 miles out from the planet Sexburga, almost too close for a proper approach.
Daniel said to his console. His fingers moved on the semaphore controls, directing the riggers to unpin the antennas.
Then through the intercom Daniel added, &nbsp;

CHAPTER TWELVE
Adele&#151;Signals Officer Mundy&#151;was busy for the first time since the Princess Cecile entered the Matrix outbound from Cinnabar. Since the events on Kostroma, really. She'd studied the corvette's electronics on the voyage to Harbor Three, and during the past seventeen hellish days she'd been learning all she could about Strymon and the adjacent planetary systems.
That had been work at her own speed&#151;which didn't mean it was done in a leisurely fashion by most people's standards, but there was no outside pressure involved. Now&#151;
GR1751 was the Princess Cecile's pennant number, which her transponder sent automatically when interrogated Adele had reconfigured the communications console to use wand control as its default. This wasn't ideal, as a computer capable of missile launches and astrogation had a much broader range of options than a civilian database. Adele preferred to layer command sets within her wands' existing software rather than use the virtual keyboard created for the console. It was still much faster, and for her there was less risk of an error.
Her hands moved, sending the core of the message from Condor Control&#151;the station that handled starship traffic for all Sexburga&#151;to Daniel's display in visual form. The course plot, the time parameters, and the two smaller harbors with their approach cones were instantly visible; if Daniel for some reason wanted the audio message as well, he had only to key an icon to get it.
That was the open part of Adele's duties. At the same time she'd entered the Condor database covertly and copied from it the complete records of landings and departures from the planet in the past thirty days. Her real concern&#151;Daniel's real concern&#151;was to see when and whether Commodore Pettin had arrived, but for safety's sake Adele had given her search broader parameters.
RCS Tampico, arrived four days previous. From . . . Adele's wands moved . . . Holtsmark, berthed at Slip Thirty-two, Flood Harbor. She accessed another file, this one internal RCN records held in the Princess Cecile's database. RCS Tampico, communications vessel, 1700 tons empty; defensive armament only. the controller on Sexburga said. The speaker was male, probably in his forties, and sounded alertly professional. He hissed his esses and more generally spoke with a soft lilt; Adele decided to class the peculiarities as a Sexburga accent until she learned otherwise.
A schematic appeared in gold light on the left side of Adele's display. It was offset from but identical to the harbor plan from the Princess Cecile's database. The local transmission also showed cigar-shaped vessels settled in roughly half the fifty-seven slips. Sexburga was clearly a major port, though most of the ships berthed here were of moderate size.
Adele framed the plan and retransmitted it to a suspense file serving the command console while Daniel set up his final approach. It was received, becoming a sidebar on the upper left corner of a screen almost completely filled by numerical data.
Adele said. Nothing went to the command console until it had been cleared through Adele's filters and then requested by the captain. The captain could set up categories for immediate update&#151;this harbor schematic, for example&#151;but even so the data didn't appear on Daniel's display until he called for it. The priorities were determined by a human being.
Adele returned her attention to the right half of her display, another RCN internal file: current deployment orders for RCN vessels. The Tampico was on a triangular run from Sexburga to the Cinnabar outpost at Fort Hill Station and finally to Langerhut, an allied system with a Resident Commissioner but almost no direct contact with Cinnabar. The Tampico carried dispatches, supplies, and personnel who were being transferred. The vessel wasn't connected with Commodore Pettin's squadron.
The Princess Cecile braked under one-gee acceleration. Even to the naked eye, the image of Sexburga swelled on the real-time display at the margin of Adele's screen. Speaking loudly to be heard over the whine of antimatter annihilation, Sun said to Betts, Betts nodded solemnly. He was clearing his display of the targeting fantasies that had preserved him in the Matrix, moving methodically through a checklist. he breathed.
A wonder indeed.&nbsp;
There were no other RCN vessels on Sexburga or in the PCT-3301 system of which Sexburga was the fourth planet. Adele moved to checking grouped arrivals.
Three ships had arrived in hailing range of Condor Control within minutes of one another a week ago, but they were freighters from three separate systems linked only by chance. Adele called up visuals from the Flood Harbor security cameras and proved beyond doubt that the ships weren't warships, let alone Commodore Pettin's squadron with disguised identities.
She thought a smile that eventually touched her lips. She was obviously being obsessive. In that, at least, she'd make a good spacer.
Adele had tapped into the automated stream of Sexburgan meteorological data as soon as the Princess Cecile emerged from the Matrix. The first and last twenty thousand feet of a voyage were statistically the most dangerous, because starships weren't streamlined for operations in an atmosphere.
The corvette's hull was a cylinder with rounded ends, a stable enough shape initially. The antennas and rigging on the exterior, however, created turbulence as well as twisting the vessel off-line when they caught gusts of wind. Even though ships in an atmosphere moved with the deliberation of belles making their entrances, they were fitted with sensor suites to make their own observations from space to be compared with whatever the planetary controller supplied.
Daniel let out his breath in a long sigh and flopped back in his seat. Almost at once he straightened and resumed keying commands, now with a look of eager attention. He caught Adele's glance and grinned at her through the haze of his new task. Moments before, as he'd been setting up the approach, he'd had the rapt focus of a cat watching potential prey.
Adele echoed the navigation display in a corner of her own screen, just to see what Daniel was working on now. It was a plan of the Princess Cecile's antennas and sails, which were being collapsed for storage. Daniel would be able to understand the process by a glance at the schematic, but to Adele it was merely bumps and lines.
She would have cut away, but a red arrow suddenly careted a point on the white outline. Daniel's voice said through her communications helmet, It was hard to see details of the sail plan when it was shrunk down to a sidebar; Adele raised the schematic to three quarters of the display. She looked up to meet Daniel's eyes; he was grinning as he moved a light pen to mark the image she was importing to her console.
The caret jumped. Adele gave Daniel's explanation half her attention while she sorted the shipping log for vessels which had lifted from Cinnabar within thirty days of their arrival on Sexburga. No ship but the Princess Cecile herself would have made the voyage direct.
Daniel continued. Who appeared to be a solid pink triangle close to the six hollow ones.
On the right of Adele's display, itself now a sidebar, a single name appeared: the Achilles, a private yacht of three hundred tons. It had landed on Sexburga six hours ahead of the Princess Cecile.
Daniel continued, moving his pointer. said Adele, but she was frowning at the data on the right of her screen. The Achilles was fleet-footed indeed to have reached Sexburga only twenty-three days out from Cinnabar.
An attention signal whistled as the track lights pulsed green. a voice from the BDC reported. Dorst was speaking rather than Mon; the lieutenant was giving the midshipmen actual experience as officers, albeit in small ways.
said Daniel, captain of the Princess Cecile again instead of a friend explaining details of his expertise. He touched the command bar on the separate semaphore panel to his left, then keyed the intercom.
Daniel announced, his voice in Adele's helmet preceding by a hair's breadth its analogue through the ceiling speakers. His fingers continued to type commands as he spoke. Icons on the far left of Adele's display shifted. The whine of the High Drive ceased, and the braking thrust Adele's body perceived as gravity lessened for a heartbeat or so before the plasma thrusters roared to full life. Adele must have looked startled, because Sun glanced over at her and shouted, Adele nodded understanding. She'd known that, of course. This wasn't the first time she'd landed in a starship, for heaven's sake, nor even the first time she'd done so as an officer on the bridge with full access to the details of what was going on.
But&#151;her intellect had known what to expect. The lizard brain deep within Adele had known only that it had suddenly dropped into nothingness.
The riggers were coming through the airlock, unlatching their helmets and congratulating themselves with enthusiasm. Riggers even more than other spacers loved the void, but this had been a hard run. In the future the crew would brag to others about how Mr. Leary had brought the Princess Cecile from Cinnabar to Sexburga in seventeen days . . . but for the moment, they were glad to know they'd be walking on solid ground in an hour.
Daniel switched his display to the harbor plot. Adele, still watching her echo of the navigational console, saw pennant numbers blink into life beside each cylindrical hull. She smiled wryly. That was a much simpler route into the problem than those she'd taken.
Daniel said through her helmet. Adele said. The upper atmosphere began to buffet the corvette. Over the windroar came a bang and a momentary fluttering rattle outside the hull. Woetjans snatched the handset from beside the suit locker and shouted into it.
Daniel focused on his screen, then looked unperturbedly through the hologram toward Adele again. he said. He frowned. he continued in a careful tone. Woetjans and the riggers still wore their suits as they waited in the corridor. Delos Vaughn stood in the doorway of the wardroom, looking into the bridge past them. The hard voyage had worn him as badly as it had anybody else aboard the Princess Cecile; his face looked like a mummy's skull.
But he was smiling.
* * *
The echoes of the corvette's landing had stopped reverberating around the high cliffs of Flood Harbor, but when Daniel switched to a panoramic view he saw that a vast doughnut of steam still hung in the sky. The Harbormaster's office was a blockhouse built out from the natural rock wall at the base of the broad embayment. A vehicle pulled away from it and turned up the quay that would bring it to the Princess Cecile. That was greater efficiency than Daniel had expected on so distant a world.
He keyed the intercom and said, He paused, then added, Daniel sighed and stretched his arms back, then forward to where they muddied portions of the display. The panorama provided a holographic image of what he would see were he standing on the Princess Cecile's spine and if the rigging weren't in the way. Like quite a lot of things&#151;Daniel's fingers idly called up a file; women's faces, little mementos, cascaded across his display&#151;the image was more attractive than the reality.
He grinned. Adele got up shakily from her console and said, he said, grinning even wider. Daniel got up also. Riggers opened both doors of the forward dorsal airlock, letting in a gulp of air with touches of steam and ozone. Down the length of the ship clanks and squeals announced the undogging of hatches, both ordinary ports and the access panels used for major overhauls. Some of them would be closed again after the corvette had aired out, but for the moment everyone wanted the maximum ventilation.
The makeup of Sexburga's atmosphere differed by a few percentage points from Cinnabar's or Earth's. All that mattered just now was that it hadn't been lived in for seventeen days by over a hundred and twenty people, plus a wide variety of machinery and electronics. The corvette's filters scrubbed the carbon dioxide down to safe levels and removed actual toxins, while hydrolyzed reaction mass kept the oxygen constant; the stench was a permanent companion regardless.
After a time you no longer noticed the smell at a conscious level, but it still did damage to morale and efficiency. Like a mild toothache, the omnipresent discomfort of bad air robbed spacers of those top few points of intellect which could mean life or death in a dangerous environment. Flushing the ship's atmosphere was the first and most longed-for reward of landing after a long voyage.
Daniel continued, quirking Adele his grin, Feeling a little embarrassed, he added, said Adele, with a smile that looked suspiciously like a smirk. The corridor was filling with spacers who'd changed into their shoregoing clothes. For Betts, Taley, and the midshipmen, that meant dress grays. The same was probably true of Pasternak, though Daniel didn't see him. The chief bunked in the office attached to the power room on A Level rather than in the warrant-officer accommodations here on C.
The lower-ranking crewmen and the officers who'd first shipped as common spacers wore liberty dress. These had started out as sets of utilities, but the owners had decorated them during off-duty periods in space.
Woetjans's liberty suit was the highest state of the art Daniel had seen. What with appliques, cutwork, embroidery, studs, and the ribbons fluttering from the seams, there wasn't a thread of the wave-pattern fatigues visible.
Daniel said, feeling a touch of embarrassment. He should have broached this sooner. It was going to sound like he wanted to be shut of her company on the ground, which was far from the truth. Adele said. She grinned, reminding him that she must have been a child once upon a time. On B Level, the accommodations deck, at least a dozen spacers were singing, Daniel cleared his throat. he said. He shrugged. he added. Adele said carefully. She didn't seem hostile to the idea, though would be a fair description of her attitude. Well, would generally describe Adele's attitude.
Daniel said, trying to explain a concept that was more subtle than words could really express. His words, at any rate. His voice trailed off. He wasn't much beyond their age now, not in years. Had his first commanding officer, Commander Gray, felt this way about him?
Daniel continued, feeling his face warm as he looked at himself with the eyes of Midshipman Daniel Leary, age eighteen. A smile drove the self-conscious embarrassment from Daniel's face. Voicing the thought he said, Sobering he went on, Actually, he could: he was captain of the Princess Cecile, and if he ordered his crew to spend their whole liberty in church, regulations permitted him to do so. His chance of having anybody report aboard for the next leg of the cruise was a great deal more problematic, however.
Adele nodded. she said. She looked down at her rumpled utilities. Daniel said. Adele said with a faint smile. She stepped toward the suite she shared with him. Adele paused, looking back over her shoulder. Grinning broadly, Daniel keyed first the attention signal and then the PA system. he ordered.
Hogg stepped onto the bridge, wearing his version of liberty dress&#151;high boots, red beret, orange pantaloons, and a canary yellow shirt with flaring sleeves. He'd been waiting politely in the passage for his master and Adele to finish their conversation. he said, Daniel said. Hogg drew himself up, which still left him a hand's breadth short of Daniel's own modest height. he said in a tone of injured innocence, He cleared his throat and added, Daniel said. Daniel watched the vivid form of his servant disappear down the companionway. Hogg had grown grayer day by day during the long, brutal voyage. It wasn't so much a physical change as a lowering of the intense spirit that usually animated his pudgy form. He'd never flinched, let alone complained, but Daniel wasn't sure how much reserve there'd been remaining.
Perhaps very little&#151;but Hogg had always rebounded swiftly.
Delos Vaughn came out of his berth, dressed in a flowing blend of blues and greens. His servant, Timmins, watched him head for the bridge. When he was sure of Vaughn's intention, Timmins ducked down the companionway. He was still wearing fatigues, having waited to change into liberty dress until he'd attended to the passenger.
Daniel's eyes narrowed slightly. To get that sort of service from a spacer after a voyage like the one just ended, Vaughn must be paying quite well. Which shouldn't have been a surprise, of course.
Vaughn paused at the bridge hatchway. he asked. Daniel said. It didn't bother Daniel, but he'd noticed that Vaughn always called him by his rank, lieutenant, rather than his position as captain of the Princess Cecile. If the choice was a political game, Daniel didn't understand it. But perhaps Vaughn was just ignorant, the niceties of shipboard usage having passed him by.
It didn't exactly bother Daniel.
Vaughn said as he stepped over the hatch coaming a trifle shakily. He spoke normally, but his cheeks had sunk noticeably in the past seventeen days. Daniel reached over to Bett's console&#151;his own keyboard was out of reach from where he stood&#151;and brought up the panoramic view with quick keystrokes. He hoped he wasn't frowning at Vaughn, though he wouldn't pretend that he really cared that much.
he said, adjusting the display to expand the quay to which a team of riggers was extending the corvette's gangplank.
Vaughn said. Daniel said in a quiet voice. Indeed, that was Zane standing ramrod straight beside the open door of the ground car now waiting on the quay. Daniel had thought the vehicle was bringing harbor officials to handle the administrative details of the Princess Cecile's stay on Sexburga. Vaughn shrugged. he said. Adele had come out of her cabin; Tovera straightened an everted pleat of her mistress's jacket with fingers as thin and white as if they were merely the bones. The midshipmen waited stiffly in the passage, their faces scrubbed and saucer hats in their hands. Vesey was squinching forward, apparently in an attempt to minimize the grease stain she'd somehow managed to get between her first and second jacket buttons.
Daniel said, changing the subject back to one he felt comfortable with, said Vaughn. A flash of anger suggested that at heart he didn't see any reason ever that his will should be thwarted, but the emotion was gone as quickly as it appeared. What Daniel realized was that Vaughn was making the invitation a matter of planet-to-planet protocol. Why he'd want to do that was puzzling, though a simple desire to get his own way would be a believable explanation; but Vaughn certainly had the power to make trouble for Daniel on the grounds of a political snub if the invitation was refused.
Daniel said. Daniel wasn't under any illusions about Vaughn's instinct to dominate, but it wasn't something that put the man outside the pale in the mind of an RCN officer. More important was the fact that the young nobleman controlled his impulses. Whatever Vaughn might have been at the core, his intellect made him a civilized man who operated within the norms he found around him; and it was intellect, after all, that divided men from beasts.
Vaughn said with a smile, bowing as crisply as a punch notching a ticket. He turned and strode to the companionway, nodding in friendly acknowledgment to the midshipmen. The interchange with Daniel had restored Vaughn's poise: he walked with none of the stiffness and doubtful balance that had hampered him when he entered the bridge.
Adele stepped to Daniel's side. In a low voice she commented, Daniel looked at his friend sharply, not quite certain that she was joking. Deciding he didn't want to ask a question that might have the wrong answer, he said, He glanced sidelong at Adele and raised an eyebrow. She shrugged and said, In the glum pause that followed, Tovera turned her palm up. The slight movement called attention to her. Daniel started: it was like a magician's illusion. Poof! and Adele's servant stood where his mind hadn't registered anything a moment before.
Tovera said. In place of the coveralls she'd worn during the voyage, she'd donned baggy gray slacks and a beige shirt that would have hung to her knees if it hadn't been belted at her waist. The loosely bloused fabric could conceal any number of weapons or other devices&#151;and probably did.
Adele said, her words as careful as the taps of a gem-cutter. Tovera said. She smiled; the expression belonged on a bird of prey. She took a ring of dark hematite with a simple gold inlay from a purse hidden under the drape of her blouse, then slid it on her left little finger. Adele said. She tapped the personal data unit that she used for communication. Tovera might have a mastoid implant for all Daniel knew, though a simple pager the size of a pea would be sufficient.
Tovera said as she walked away. Daniel shook his head in wonderment. It was like seeing the shadow of death thrown on the corridor bulkhead.
Adele said in a bleak voice, Daniel hadn't had the least intention of asking. He put his hand on Adele's shoulder and squeezed it, reassuring both of them that their truths remained.
Adele looked at the image Daniel had called up on the attack console. The gangplank was an internally braced structure that could unfold an entire twenty yards if necessary, though Daniel had brought the corvette much closer than that to the concrete slip. The Princess Cecile's crew, bright and fluttering in their liberty dress, crossed in loose formation. The crew from the anchor watch who'd just extended the gangplank watched their singing, laughing, fellows without expression.
Daniel sighed. Well, that was why he was aboard himself. A captain had to be willing to carry out unpleasant duties occasionally, if he expected his crew to obey when he ordered them to do things they'd rather not. Which, after all, covered most of the activities aboard a warship.
Adele said. She sat at the console, apparently oblivious of her surroundings, and began switching between screens without bothering to explain what she was doing. The view of the dock shrank to a corner of the display.
Daniel said. Dorst and Vesey remained at the hatchway, teetering with nervous anticipation. He crooked his finger to bring them to him. Adele said with satisfaction, leaning her head aside. Daniel stooped to bring his head into position to read the personnel manifest the yacht had filed with the Harbormaster. Fifty-three crew&#151;a large complement for a 300-ton vessel, but she was carrying the sails of a much larger hull&#151;and one passenger: Mistress Thea Zane.
he said, straightening. His smile had a degree of calculation in it. He straightened and gestured to Adele. She switched the console back to a full-sized image of the dock and stood, nodding to the midshipmen to show that she was aware of them. On the display Vaughn gripped arms with Mistress Zane, then got into the closed car with her help. Obviously, he wasn't fully recovered from the voyage.
Well, neither was Daniel, though he was getting there. He forced his face into a serious expression and said, He was fairly confident that the midshipmen had no real plans, just concern sparked by the tall tales they were bound to have heard. They'd be afraid that they wouldn't measure up to what was expected of an RCN officer.
Daniel cleared his throat. Vesey said. Her tongue caught and she glanced at Dorst. Dorst said with relieved enthusiasm. He wanted to say but he suddenly doubted that was the right word. Wisely, Daniel thought, he let his voice trail off.
Adele seemed to be on the verge of open laughter; which, if not a first, certainly wasn't something she had great experience with. Still working to keep his face straight, Daniel said, You had to know what you were looking for to see the flat bulge in the side pocket of Adele's jacket. If the midshipmen had heard the stories about what Adele could and had done with her pistol, they probably classed them with the stories about the night Barnes serviced all thirty of the girls in a brothel on LaGrange, having reached the madam just as dawn broke.
she said solemnly. Dorst assured her. He broke off and pointedly didn't look at Vesey.
Vesey said primly, her eyes fixed on the far bulkhead also. Adele said as she shepherded her charges toward the corridor. She tapped the pocket with her data unit.
She nodded to Daniel as she followed the midshipmen down the companionway; a thin, stiff-looking woman in dress grays. He winked in reply. Yes, they'd be all right; no question about that.
The people telling about Barnes' exploit exaggerated: there'd only been fifteen women in the house, not thirty-one. And they exaggerated about Adele as well. She hadn't really killed a hundred Alliance soldiers on Kostroma with single shots to the head, snapping the rounds off every time a target offered.
But it probably wasn't as much of an exaggeration as the story about Barnes.

CHAPTER THIRTEEN
Nine funicular railways climbed from Flood Harbor to the city of Spires on beyond the cliffs. Three were for personnel, leaving at fifteen-minute intervals according to the scarred metal plate in the shelter where Adele stood with the midshipmen. The others were much larger, with cogged rails to give positive traction to heavy loads. They hauled cargo to and from the freighters berthed in slips formed from golden limestone quarried from the cliffs themselves.
Dorst said, looking back at the rounded hulls of starships which showed over the slips like so many oxen in their stalls. Adele said, restraining the urge to bring out her personal data unit and show the boy the reference. The funicular lines carried two cars in balance, going up and down simultaneously on a single set of tracks with a double-tracked shunt in the middle where they passed. The lower set of pulleys squealed loudly as the cars above reached midpoint.
Adele eyed them without pleasure. The cables were no thicker than her thumb, which seemed modest when they had to support forty-odd passengers and the vehicle against a thousand-foot fall. Deliberately she said, She gestured.
Dorst said, forgetting he was supposed to treat her as a peer. Vesey said. They both reacted to Adele with a sort of frightened deference. It wasn't her rank: though they were classed as petty officers for the time being, Dorst and Vesey were in line for commissions which would make them the titular superiors of any warrant officer, let alone a specialist like Adele who knew virtually nothing about the running of a starship.
Her question, crafted to emphasize that ignorance, must have relaxed them somewhat, though. Vesey, her eyes on the approaching car, added, Good God, they thought she was Daniel's mistress.
Adele said calmly, suppressing the urge to shout, in anger at the obtuseness of people. That was an honest if incomplete way of describing the Three Circles Conspiracy and the Proscriptions that followed it.
She was tempted to add that they were doing Daniel a disservice in believing he was the sort of man whose penis made all his decisions. She didn't say that because it wasn't her place to; and in fairness to the midshipmen, Daniel's off-duty behavior could lead one to that conclusion.
The pulleys divided the waiting area. There was a mounting platform on either side of the tracks, though Adele could see that the descending car had a single bay. She and the midshipmen had walked to the right side because a dozen or so Sexburgan traders were already waiting on the left.
The locals, males and females both, wore loose blouses gathered at the openings, and drab-colored pantaloons with heavy sandals. One of the younger men carried two racks of candy trays, mostly emptied, on a yoke. He noticed Vesey&#151;quite an attractive girl, now that Adele thought about it&#151;and postured for her, arms akimbo.
Vesey deliberately turned her back on him and said, The question&#151;the words couldn't be heard on the other side of the shrieking cable&#151;was simply to remove the local man from her society. After a moment the fellow fluffed his full mustache and also turned away, though he was still puffed out like a rooster displaying.
Adele found it hard not to provide information even if it wasn't really expected. she said. The car shuddered to a halt. It was full, or nearly so, of spacers returning from liberty, and it looked to Adele as if there were as many planetary backgrounds represented as there were people.
That didn't necessarily mean they were from different ships. A dark-skinned woman whose rough-out leathers were embroidered in eye patterns helped a male shipmate who was thin, blond, and wore only a silk shift and a beret. They were both drunk, but the woman could at least walk; her companion, hopping up and down, babbled in accented Universal that his feet had been cut off.
The peddlers got on, nodding in tired acknowledgment as Adele and the midshipmen boarded the car from the other side. The locals had finished their day, going from ship to ship to serve the spacers still on duty.
Adele noticed from the way the returning panniers and satchels swung, they weren't always empty. Almost the first thing she'd learned when she began associating with spacers was that no matter how open a society might look from the outside, there was always something it considered contraband; and there were always smugglers ready to supply that contraband to whoever could afford it.
She smiled coldly. Since that seemed to be a universal trait, she supposed it was the way things were supposed to be. Adele had never been one to argue against observed reality.
Though that did leave the question of who or what had set up the system in the first place. Adele didn't believe in a supreme being; but occasionally it seemed that things couldn't possibly be so damnably absurd unless someone, Someone, was deliberately making them that way.
Dorst said, craning his neck to peer up the cableway. It was hard to tell from the midshipman's voice whether he was disappointed or relieved. Probably a little of both.
The top cable grew taut. Adele braced herself on one of the vertical poles that doubled as support for the canopy, and the car started upward with a jerk.
Adele said dryly. Vesey said; an apparent non sequitur until she added, Dorst gasped and turned away, coughing or laughing. Vesey's face lost all expression as she reviewed what she'd just blurted. She had a naturally dark complexion, so the blush took some moments to show on her cheeks.
Adele said. She hid her smile, though perhaps Vesey would have felt better if she let it show. She frowned, looking back at the harbor now hundreds of feet below. The question reminded her that she wanted to find Daniel data on the natural history of all the planets in the region. That should be possible on Sexburga.
she went on. The young peddler with the candy trays leaned forward. he said with polite earnestness. added a local woman, a substantial person holding a basket woven in slant patterns in varicolored straw. The other peddlers nodded, all those who could hear over the sounds of the car rising. A more distant man held a whispered conversation with the woman with the basket, then nodded enthusiastic agreement.
Dorst said. Adele said, speaking carefully. She was repeating what she'd read, and she didn't want to give the impression that she had an opinion beyond the words in the Sailing Directions. the man with the candy trays said fiercely. That was indeed a safe bet. This funicular rose very steeply, but the one halfway around the bowl to the left followed a notch at no more than 45 degrees. Spaced along the tracks were three taverns that had been cut into the cliff face. Bunting fluttered from their railings, and at the uppermost a naked girl danced on a barreltop to lure custom. There were mounting platforms set where the slow-moving cars would just clear them, but Adele couldn't imagine people as drunk as the spacers who'd descended in this car managing to board on the move.
said Dorst, who seemed to have been thinking along the same lines.
Vesey added. The car was nearing the upper terminus; brakes within the take-up drum began to groan as they slowed the rig. Down in the harbor a bell chimed faintly, calling watch changes within a ship which had been opened to the world around it.
Dorst said. Adele said. Why were they asking her about shiphandling? That was their business! Vesey said. Her face was screwed up with the tension of someone who knows there's a secret key to the universe and that someone else has it. Dorst said. The car shuddered to what Adele thought was a halt. She would have stepped&#151;up a handsbreadth&#151;to the platform, but she noticed that the peddlers were waiting. She waited also; thus the final jolt upward didn't throw her onto her face.
Adele said. She stepped onto the platform, then gestured at the pale blue sky streaked by horsetails of vapor.
Vesey said, The upper platform was crowded with hawkers, touts, and pimps. The peddlers passed through them as water does a screen, but they were around Adele and her companions like goldfish feeding. The voices babbled in Universal&#151;
&#151;but it was spoken in a singsong that had nothing to do with the normal accent and ictus of the lines. After a moment it was perfectly understandable, like a document printed in an unfamiliar typeface. The pack wasn't saying anything Adele wanted to understand, of course.
Dorst's broad shoulders led the trio through without real difficulty. Adele, last in line, saw an old fellow with a waxed mustache try to grope Vesey. She slapped him away with a practiced reflex. Nobody offered Adele indignities.
A wide roadway paralleled the line of the cliffs. Traffic was heavy, but it was almost entirely of pedestrians or slow-moving vehicles with four large wheels. They were geared for the steep slopes on all the city's other streets.
Adele nodded and the three of them started across. On the other side were five- and six-story buildings. The windows of the lower floors advertised business premises, but the railed balconies higher up had flower boxes and lounging spectators.
Dorst said glumly as the trio waited in mid-street for an electric-powered dray to crawl past on tracks instead of wheels. Adele agreed, Vesey said. Dorst leaned forward to see past the dray. he shouted.
They sprinted to the overlook. Traffic direction wasn't controlled by which side of the street it was on, but the midshipmen seemed to have the spacers' ability to look all ways at once. Adele didn't and by now had determined that she never would, but by staying between her companions she managed to make it across with no worse problem than tripping on a crack between paving blocks. Vesey caught her.
The view was breathtaking. Though not nearly as steep as the cliffs they'd just climbed, the ground to the east sloped down for as far as Adele could see. Beyond the buildings of Spires stretched fields separated by drystone walls. The crops were planted so thinly that the predominant color was that of the russet soil, not green leaves.
Adele said, Vesey said in surprise. Dorst added. Vesey said. Adele nodded slowly as she viewed her surroundings. Plenty of reaction mass, even if it didn't fall as rain. She was a spacer now, so she had to remind herself to think like one.
Dorst said, reverting to the earlier subject. Scattered across the landscape were buttes standing a hundred feet above the plain around them. One was topped by a man-made wall; a dusty road led to it from the city proper.
Adele said, bringing her data unit out and&#151;after a moment of trepidation&#151;setting it on the stone railing instead of sitting crosslegged on the pavement to use it. The rail was flat and six inches wide, so there was no real danger that she'd bump the unit down the other side. She scrolled across a street plan of Spires till she found what she was looking for, then compared it with her own location according to the data unit's inertial navigation system. Sexburga didn't have positioning satellites, just a handful of ground beacons for the rare traveller who went any distance from Spires.
she said, nodding toward her display. She couldn't point because she held a wand in either hand. Dorst said with enthusiasm.
Adele said. She put her data unit away and started toward the nearest of the streets leading down into the city proper.
Vesey asked in a tiny voice.
Adele said in a tone of confidence that surprised her, Adele went on in the same crisp voice. Dorst and Vesey both hesitated a half step, then burst out laughing. Adele allowed herself a smile as well.
She found the presence of the midshipmen oddly pleasant, rather like having a pair of intelligent dogs along to share her interests without imposing their own. This layover on Sexburga promised to be quite relaxing.
* * *
Hogg said as he hauled hard on the steering wheel to bring them around the final switchback. Hogg had rented the car to bring them to Vaughn's party, but Daniel was half wishing he'd simply paid for a cabman to drive instead. The vehicle couldn't manage more than twenty miles an hour with the throttle flat against the firewall, but steering required a lot less effort than Hogg put into it since the wheel adjusted power to the hub-center electric motors, speeding or slowing them as the turn required.
That offended Hogg. He needed to hear chirps and moans from a vehicle to be sure it was really under his control.
Daniel said, looking into the compound past the attendant at the open gate. The walls were seven feet thick. Hogg stopped smoothly beside the attendant despite his effort to get the regenerative brakes to jerk them to a halt. he muttered. The comment seemed intended to inform the car that no matter how well it had been designed, it was still crap because it hadn't been made on Cinnabar.
The attendant wore boots to mid calf, checked trousers, and a red frock coat with a gold dicky. He wasn't dressed like a Sexburgan or like anybody else Daniel remembered seeing, though some clowns came close. Mind, the Dress Whites Daniel was wearing weren't the most practical garments either.
the fellow said. Daniel frowned. There was no question of his having gotten the address wrong: this walled compound on a hill ten miles east of Spires was the only possible structure that matched Vaughn's directions. Besides, from the dozen vehicles&#151;two of them aircars&#151;already in the courtyard, there was a party going on.
Hogg said, sounding more disgusted than angry. the attendant said, waving to the guard watching from the tower above the gate. The tower windows were beveled sharply so that the automatic impeller mounted there could fire down onto the access road. He waved to the courtyard. Another attendant waved from the door of the narrow three-story building directly across the courtyard. He was dressed like the gate man, but his coat was azure blue instead of scarlet. Apparently it was a national style rather than livery.
Hogg engaged the motors. Over their whine he muttered, Daniel said. He cleared his throat. Weeks in the Matrix had roughened Hogg's personality beyond its normal degree of abrasiveness. Daniel understood his servant's xenophobia, but it couldn't be allowed to get out of hand.
Daniel didn't share Hogg's attitude. So far as he was concerned, foreigners were perfectly all right. Some of them were almost the equal of Cinnabar citizens.
The building's top story was completely glazed; from there figures with drinks in their hands looked down. Most of them wore flashy Strymon costumes, though one was in garb cut like that of the attendants. His coat was black over a white cummerbund rather than of bright colors.
Hogg muttered as he pulled in at the end of a row of similar though more ornate vehicles. Before Daniel had managed the car door&#151;it hinged at the back edge, not the front as he was used to&#151;Delos Vaughn himself brushed past the attendant and called, Besides the residence, the compound held a power room&#151;the blow-off roof on a squat, thick-walled structure pointed to a fusion bottle inside&#151;and a utility building holding shops, a kitchen, and a laundry. The long, one-story building along the back wall was a barracks if Daniel had ever seen one. Fortress indeed!
Daniel let Vaughn take his arm because the other choice was to slap the fellow's hand away. No point in coming at all if he was going to do that.
he said as they entered the building. The walls were decorated with a mural of lush meadows, an incongruous contrast to Sexburga's sere landscape. An open elevator waited across the tiled foyer.
Vaughn said with a chuckle. The elevator door closed behind them without any command that Daniel noticed. The Berengians were five&#151;or occasionally seven&#151;stars in loose confederation. The little Daniel knew of their political history reminded him of watching piglets squirming against a sow with two more offspring than teats.
The elevator started with a gentle hum. There weren't any controls inside the circular cage. The curved mirror of the walls gave Daniel a view of himself looking uncomfortable in the white-and-gold of his 1st Class uniform.
Daniel said. Of course he wanted to pry. This place was defended like an outpost on the edge of Alliance territory.
Vaughn said. Daniel nodded. The pension was cost effective if it wasn't practical to assassinate the pensioner. That explained the compound's defenses.
The elevator door rotated open, a section of the gleaming metal vanishing into itself like an oil film. The guests already within the large room stared at Daniel appraisingly; the servants paused.
said Vaughn, There was a dusting of applause. Those who held drinks tapped the fingertips of their free hand on the wrist of the other.
Servants began to circulate again with trays of drinks and finger food. It was obvious that Daniel had been given an arrival time&#151;which he'd met within thirty seconds&#151;later than that of the other guests.
He stepped out of the cage, his face stiff in his determination not to give anything away. He didn't have enough information to know what was going on, but he was in no doubt that something was happening beyond Vaughn proving he could crack the whip over Daniel on land as surely as Daniel had done to him on Cinnabar. He'd learned that much about politics by being Speaker Leary's son.
Vaughn continued as though he were reading Daniel's mind, Daniel said, controlling his irritation as well as he could. He heard what he'd said and frowned. At any rate, he hoped that was true. Pride was a funny thing, especially when you were in the middle of a lot of foreigners.
Vaughn said, gesturing Daniel toward the tall man in the black coat. He was in his sixties, with short hair, gray eyes, and a face whose fleshy lips were the only hint of softness. The Captal and Daniel gripped elbows, forearm to forearm. Daniel was surprised to note that so ascetic-looking a man wore perfume.
Vaughn went on, nodding to the woman Daniel had met on Cinnabar. Vaughn went around the gathering, introducing Daniel to one Strymon national after another. Some, like Angele&#151;a heavy-bodied, hard-eyed fellow who spoke mainly in grunts&#151;were expatriates with businesses on Sexburga, but Zane and most of the others present were normally resident on Strymon itself.
This was obviously a gathering of conspirators. The Captal was involved either through family friendship as Vaughn claimed, or simply the desire of a born intriguer to keep his hand in, even if that meant meddling in others' affairs for lack of his own.
The question remaining as Daniel embraced his way around the room was why he was present.
The last guest was equally anomalous, a man of thirty-odd in clothes of closely tailored Cinnabar cut. Vaughn said, Daniel said, clasping Gerson and stepping thankfully away. Gerson looked healthy enough, but his muscles felt doughy and his breathing was fast and shallow. Was Gerson a Cinnabar spy? Supposedly the Office of External Relations always had someone on a resident's staff, and a strategic port like Sexburga might attract other organizations as well.
That line of consideration brought Daniel's mind uncomfortably back to Adele. He wished again she was here; or, even better, that he himself wasn't.
Gerson said. And just how peaceful is this gathering? Daniel thought, though all he said aloud was, Gerson said. If Gerson was trying to hide his bitterness, he was doing a very poor job. Was the man drunk?
Daniel said, turning slightly as he spoke as though he was being drawn by the view out the windows. The Strymonian guests had formed a group beside a statue that looked like tall hands reaching up from the floor. They spoke in low voices, their eyes on Daniel instead of on one another.
Gerson affected Daniel like a bad smell: bearable if necessary, but something to be avoided whenever possible. Daniel said, to the servant who came by with a tray of drinks. He snatched one that turned out to be pink and frothy; sweet as well, but when it hit the back of his throat he had to admit it was sufficiently potent.
Delos Vaughn had noticed the awkwardness. His brow furrowed, then cleared in an ingenuous smile as he said, the Captal said as he turned toward Daniel. He picked up a slender, arm's-length rod from a display of knickknacks and sliced it absently in a figure eight. It took Daniel a moment to realize that other items on the table included thumbscrews and manacles with spiked protrusions on the inside.
Daniel said. The Captal tapped the table with his rod. Daniel had taken it for translucent plastic at first; now he realized it was the penis bone of a carnivorous mammal or mammaloid that must weigh tons. Or be hung like a horse, of course.
the Captal said. Daniel sipped, careful not to drain the bit of his drink remaining. He held his liquor as befitted an officer of the RCN, but this pink fluff was deceptively strong. He didn't know how long the party was going to go on, and he was quite sure that he didn't want to blurt something in an uncontrolled moment.
Blurt what, he had no idea. All he knew for certain was that these people had an agenda of their own, and that Lt. Daniel Leary was a pawn they were maneuvering for purposes that weren't his own.
Daniel said, He almost said, but caught himself in time.
The Captal's face became a mask of cold fury. He lashed the table with the penis bone, a snap! like nearby lightning.
Daniel continued. If the exiled ruler cut at him with the penis bone, Daniel was going to take it away and worry about the consequences later. Cinnabar nobles had never lacked for arrogance, but theirs was the pride of oligarchs who knew that even the greatest of them was merely first among equals. Autocrats, even fallen autocrats like the Captal, were a wholly different breed.
The Captal dropped the rod disdainfully. he said. Daniel said, trying to keep a straight face. Imagine this Berengian rube implying similarity between himself and Speaker Leary! said Mistress Keeton, a Strymonian who'd been introduced as Her clothes were of Sexburgan cut but colored in vivid vertical stripes like nothing Daniel had seen on local citizens. a Mr. Cherry said. The gathering under the bronze hands had broken up, and the conspirators were drifting closer to Daniel. He grinned at Daniel, then to the Captal. A servant took Daniel's glass and substituted a full one. He'd noticed many times in the past that the drinks he held seemed to vanish as if by osmosis through the sides of his glass. Still, a few drinks, however strong, weren't going to be a problem.
Daniel said with a lift of his hand. The Captal da Lund stood with his back to the window, his hands on his hips. Behind him russet fields stretched away to the horizon. He looked as though he ought to have been on a dais.
the Captal announced in a sepulchral voice. Delos Vaughn said with an easy smile. Daniel said, a little more forcefully than he might have done if he hadn't first slugged down his fresh drink.
Vaughn meant himself, of course, and he was probably correct in his self-assessment. But Lt. Daniel Leary could see and could act also . . . and his vision didn't include a Leary of Bantry digging around on South Land at the whim of an exiled wog.
Daniel took a full glass from the servant headed toward him and raised it. he said. Everybody drank, but an appraising glint came into the eyes of Delos Vaughn. It remained there until the gathering broke up at the end of the hour.

CHAPTER FOURTEEN
said the man behind Adele in the buffet line. said Tovera, speaking through the bead placed deep in Adele's right ear canal. It dulled her normal hearing on that side of her head, but it was the only alternative to a surgical implant in her mastoid bone if she wanted commentary from her servant. Adele said. She smiled, though she'd learned that didn't help put others at their ease with her. Some called her smile wintry, while others were less charitable. the fellow said with a deprecating laugh. Adele reached the head of the table. She took a plate and began plumping food onto it. Although normally abstemious, she'd been extremely poor for fifteen years. The habit of eating everything she could get at formal gatherings of this sort, common in Academe, was so deeply ingrained in her that it could be described as a conditioned response.
Adele said truthfully. The next dish looked like candied beetles. She took one; poverty was even better than travel for making one open to new experiences. According to Tovera, there were three hundred and forty-seven guests in addition to fifty-odd staff members and the guests' two hundred servants. Cherry agreed. He seemed somewhat surprised at the food piling up on Adele's plate, then looked quickly away to avoid commenting on it. The Residency and its several outbuildings stood on the cliff south of Flood Harbor. If you looked past the buffet tables through the fourth-floor windows&#151;small with thick glazing against the frequent winter storms&#151;you could watch the ocean tossing sullenly all the way to the horizon. The complex was much older than Sexburga's agreement to become an Ally and Protectorate of the Republic early in the past century.
The stack on Adele's plate had risen beyond the practical possibility of adding to it. With a longing glance at a tray of unfamiliar sliced meats, she stepped back&#151;then paused to snatch a roll.
Tovera was outside in the van which had brought Adele to the party, watching a bank of images transmitted by tiny cameras secreted in every room of the Residence. Their fish-eye lenses distorted the views to the point Adele would have found them useless, but Tovera seemed to have no difficulty.
Adele didn't see any reason for such paranoia; but then, she wouldn't have suggested her servant bring a submachine gun to Delos Vaughn's party on Cinnabar. She could certainly appreciate Tovera's fastidious attention to the details of her profession.
Large though the Residency was, the present number of guests comfortably filled it. Most were well-fed and all but the Cinnabar nationals from the RCN and the Commissioner's staff wore bright costumes, though they differed widely in style. Perhaps half the number were Sexburgans; the others came from at least a dozen other worlds within the Republic's sphere of influence.
Lt. Mon got up with three locals who'd been crushed against him at a tiny table, apparently a father, mother, and their strikingly attractive daughter. Mon tossed off another tumbler of tawny liquor. He looked stunned by the attention. Adele was virtually certain that he'd never imagined he'd ever be part of a gathering like this. The daughter took his arm as the parents beamed.
Cherry and Adele moved to the just-vacated table as Mon and his new friends walked toward the stairs to the roof garden. Adele asked as they waited for a servant to clear the table of litter.
Cherry said, settling down opposite her. He was in his forties and well-fed, if not exactly fat. Adele said. She started with the candied bug since it seemed to watch her sadly from its perch at the edge of her dish. Cherry tapped the side of his nose. he said, Adele swallowed, hoping that her shocked expression would be put down to the mouthful she'd just consumed. The bug had been pickled before being coated with honey; the combination of flavors would take a great deal of getting used to.
she said. Adele had bitten back a retort along the lines of, when she recalled that she had duties to Mistress Sand. If this fat civilian was ready to blurt secrets to Mr. Leary's light-o'-love, then it wasn't the business of Mistress Sand's agent to disabuse him.
Cherry agreed through a nibble of bread. Tovera agreed. Adele said mildly as she speared a sausage from her plate. Another result of her earlier privations was that she tended to the foods of the highest calory and protein content; starches and greens were relatively cheap. Cherry said. Surely no one could be so great a fool as to believe that anything shared among conspirators as amateurish as Cherry and his friends wouldn't also be common knowledge with anyone else who cared? said Adele. Which it did. Adele had examined Admiral Torgis's record, both the public version and the one Mistress Sand had provided. The admiral was exactly what he seemed, a well-born, reasonably competent RCN officer who'd been put in place on Sexburga because of its value as a fleet base if trouble broke out again in the Sack.
Giving a gala reception for a naval hero was perfectly in character for him. Involvement in subtle diplomatic and intelligence activity was as unlikely as Torgis defecting to the Alliance.
And to corrupt a man like Gerson, who borrowed large sums of money and spent it in the form of cash, would be no more difficult than persuading a bitch in heat to couple. Adele didn't know what Gerson's unpleasant vice was, but it was obvious that he had one.
On the third floor guests danced to the accompaniment of a percussion band which played castanets, tambourines, and a glockenspiel. The effect was melodious and, though penetrating, didn't overwhelm speech even on the outskirts of the dancers. When the stairwell door opened, however, chiming music poured out over the refreshment room. It drew the attention of all the diners.
Admiral Torgis, imposing in Dress Whites instead of civilian attire, strode out of the stairwell looking even more red-faced than he had when Adele met him in the reception line. Behind him, his right hand gripping her left and pulling her along, was a woman who could pass for his twin sister but was in fact his wife. Lady Torgis wore a white dress with gold braid in the form of panels and hussar knots: not a uniform, but close enough to one to make her Tweedledee to the admiral's Tweedledum.
Torgis boomed. Daniel Leary emerged from the stairwell at a polite distance behind Lady Torgis. Instead of dragging his companion, a striking redheaded woman, the way Torgis did his wife, Daniel supported her in the crook of his right arm. Adele would've said that the redhead looked healthy enough to climb stairs by herself, but no doubt Daniel knew his business. Climbing stairs probably wasn't the&#151;person's&#151;preferred form of exercise.
Daniel caught Adele's eye and waved his free hand to her. She smiled back, causing Cherry's face to brighten with speculation, then go studiously blank.
Behind Daniel and his tramp came a stream of other guests, panting and distressed. The line was long enough to keep the door to the third floor open; thus the dance music flooding out to announce Admiral Torgis's arrival.
Tovera said as the first couple came into view. Her running commentary continued, identifying those following Torgis as among the leading residents of Sexburga.
They were divided equally between natives and expatriates, just as Cherry had suggested. When the Resident Commissioner had decided not to wait for the elevator, all his chief guests had to follow suit.
Adele felt a faint smile play at the corners of her mouth. There were extensive floral arrangements on the buffet tables. If Admiral Torgis picked an iris and began chewing on its stem, his guests would strip the displays of iris . . . though Adele believed they were poisonous. She withstood the urge to pull out her personal data unit and get a certain answer to the question.
Admiral Torgis said. Harassed servants held a quick conclave, then shunted food from one of the serving tables to the others and brought the emptied one out to join the smaller eating tables.
Daniel said, stepping over to her while the admiral's orders were being obeyed, He looked suddenly stricken.
Tovera said in Adele's ear as the two of them rose.
Adele repeated in straight-faced amusement, touching fingertips with the redhead. She'd already noticed that women didn't clasp one another on Sexburga&#151;any more than they did on the Alliance worlds. Torgis boomed. Servants were rustling chairs from around the room. One of them had started to snatch Adele's when she stood up, then froze in horror as he realized the junior officer had become one of the admiral's pets. Working for a master whose whims were as strong and (from a diplomatic perspective) unconventional as those of Admiral Torgis must be a nervous business at best.
the admiral said in a voice that could probably be heard on the floor below over the orchestra. cried the members of his entourage, locals and expatriates evidently trying to outclap one another. They'd have been cheering just as loudly if the Resident Commissioner had called for infanticide and immediate submission to the Alliance of Free Stars. In Sexburga's social hierarchy, the Cinnabar representative was the sun and everyone else seemed desperate to become the planet in the nearest orbit.
Daniel leaned close to Adele's ear and whispered, Adele patted him lightly below his gold-encrusted right epaulette. That raised eyebrows from not only Cherry but Mistress Lully as well.
Adele said to the local woman in an accent redolent of the highest strata of Xenos society . . . to which she had, after all, belonged. Good God, I am jealous! Adele realized in shock. Not of Daniel's body, of course; but the outrage on this red-haired trollop's face at a hint of intimacy between her and Daniel had lit an unexpected fuse in Adele's mind as well.
Adele said, uncertain whether or not he could hear over the bustle, The buffet was for ordinary guests; Admiral Torgis and those about him would have a sit-down dinner. The servants were now handing the expanded entourage into chairs, trying to judge status and fearful of their master's anger if they mistook his preferences.
Daniel went into the chair at Lady Torgis's right hand. After a moment's hesitation, the stick-thin, gray-haired female majordomo put Adele herself on the admiral's right and Mr. Cherry, of course, beside her. The Strymonian businessman looked as amazed as Mon had at the preference.
There were service stairs or at least a dumbwaiter, because three servants hustled in through the side door bearing place settings. The china was blue-and-gold with the RCN insignia, but instead of metal the flatware was made of plastic or&#151;
Daniel said in unfeigned enthusiasm. Adele had her personal data unit half out of its pocket before she caught herself. Cosmographical directory, initial sort CASSITERIDES, sub-sort SCALEWARE . . .
Not her job, not necessary, and very much not the right time to call attention to herself. Daniel was bonding with the former admiral. In a thoroughly innocent fashion, of course; simply by being his own engaging self.
the admiral said. Torgis, his wife, and Daniel all bellowed with laughter. Mistress Lully looked puzzled, and the member of the admiral's staff hovering in the background winced with psychic pain.
A servant set Adele's place; she picked up the outermost spoon and examined it more closely. The material weighed amazingly little. She'd thought the color was gray, but in fact there was a lambent fire&#151;gold to green to a black that was total absence of hue&#151;at the core of the piece. It was so clear that she could read the whorls of her finger pads through it.
Daniel said, leaning toward her over the table as the fingers of his right hand caressed Ms. Lully's bare shoulders. Torgis said, bobbing his head with the animation of a man who believes he's met his soul mate. He held a fork up to the light, apparently trying to display the internal color that Adele had already noticed. Other guests peered at their host's waving utensil instead of looking at their own.
The expressions of Daniel and Admiral Torgis suddenly shifted. The humor was gone, replaced by an eager intentness. Around them the party continued to swirl.
Daniel's hand lay on Ms. Lully's back, but he had become still. A servant offered Torgis an urn of consomme she'd plucked from the serving table; another servant held the ladle ready to fill his bowl. The admiral ignored them.
Adele felt the rumble, though she wouldn't have noticed it for another minute or more had not the spacers' attitude shown her there was something to notice. Almost simultaneously the voice of Woetjans, the duty officer tonight, said through a roar of static in Adele's ear, Admiral Torgis said, said Daniel, rising to his feet. The poor servant barely avoided sloshing herself with an urn of soup. Admiral Torgis said, also rising. Ms. Lully said with a stricken pout. Daniel bent down and kissed her forehead, right at the part from which the red hair flared to either side like a boat's bow wave. the woman said. Just possibly she wasn't the bubble-brain Adele had assumed. At any rate, Lully had grasped the salient point of the situation and responded to it with impeccable logic.
Daniel said. Lully said through a recurrence of the pout. said Daniel. Mon had already pushed in through the double doors from the balcony. He walked with the studied earnestness of a man who was sure that his head would fall off if he didn't keep it centered squarely over his spine.
Daniel grimaced and turned to Adele. he said. Lifting Ms. Kira Lully, now chauffeur, in much the same fashion that he'd carried her up the stairs earlier, Daniel said to the room, He strode to the stairwell, the redhead clutched against him like pirate's booty. Though unburdened, Adele struggled to catch up. Even so Lt. Mon was treading on her heels as she reached the door. Real spacers were amazingly surefooted when moving through clutter.
Admiral Torgis cried behind them. * * *
Kira Lully held her trim red-and-gold aircar in ground effect just above the pavement until a roar of steam drowned the snarl of the Winckelmann's plasma thrusters. Only then did she drop the vehicle's nose over the cliff edge and plunge toward the Princess Cecile in spirals so tight that centrifugal force pressed the occupants outward.
Daniel had thought of suggesting he take the controls himself, but he'd kept his mouth shut for fear that the redhead would order them all out of the vehicle in a fit of pique. As it turned out, Kira was a much better driver than he was.
Also his fear that she'd blind herself by looking into the heavy cruiser's exhaust was remarkably silly when he used his head&#151;which wasn't the part of Daniel Oliver Leary most often to the fore when he was dealing with pretty girls. Obviously, nobody living adjacent to Flood Harbor could be ignorant of the dangers of starships landing and lifting off.
Lt. Mon remarked from the rear seat beside Adele. Adele asked over the echoes still hammering around the cliffs. Mon liked and respected Adele, but he had an abrasive manner at the best of times . . . which didn't include times he was as drunk as he was tonight. Before he could snap, or the like, Daniel said, Kira dived into the warm salty fog which the Winckelmann's thrusters lifted from the harbor. The big cruiser was indeed a sad sight to anyone who knew ships: a clumsy design, now overage and poorly maintained in the long interval of peace. Commodore Pettin could see that as well as any other officer of his seniority, and it would gall him like a boil on the butt.
Kira said plaintively as she fluffed them to a featherlight landing on the dock where the Princess Cecile's gangplank terminated. The harbor's surface was twitching from the nearby arrival of 13,000 tons of heavy cruiser, but the concrete slips kept other vessels from bouncing around unduly.
Adjacent to the corvette was the depot ship Admiral Torgis had moved there this morning. It was a freighter, now nameless save for its pennant number: SDN 3391. All but four antennas had been removed, and its High Drive had probably been cannibalized in the distant past to equip some warship that had limped down to Flood Harbor.
Under normal circumstances the depot ship provided stores, power for vessels whose fusion bottles were deadlined, and a repair shop. Tonight her cavernous bays were decked out with bunting, food, and liquor for the Princess Cecile's crew.
Daniel said, knowing as he framed the words that the truth was a little more complex. True, he'd been looking forward to the night and morning&#151;and who wouldn't, after the run the Princess Cecile had just made? But it was even more true that Daniel would willingly forego the redhead's charms if there was just some way he could avoid the interview with Commodore Pettin he knew was coming. Why in the name of all that's holy did the pulpit-pounding commodore have to land in the middle of the Resident Commissioner's party for the crew?
Daniel hopped over the side of the aircar without bothering to open the door. he said, Mon snarled. The Winckelmann was opening up in the usual fashion of airing ship on arrival. Hatches were lifting, the turrets for the secondary battery of plasma weapons were being cranked out to provide more room within the hull, and crewmen double-timed onto the outriggers to unlock access plates that couldn't easily be reached from inside.
Normally no one would disembark until the process was complete. This time, as soon as the hatches serving the water-level stern hold had clamshelled wide enough open, the twelve-place aircar assigned to heavy cruisers as a utility vehicle&#151;the Princess Cecile had a jeep that could carry four if they were good friends&#151;roared out.
Mon, not sober but used to functioning with a heavy load aboard, swung his legs over the side of Lully's car and ran for the depot ship with a rolling gait. The Winckelmann's arrival had called a good half the crew out already. Those who were vaguely sober were mustering less-steady comrades and helping them to the quay.
Adele tried to jump out of the aircar. She tripped, which was so likely a result that Daniel had already turned to grab her when he realized what she intended. He swung her to her feet, then tucked her into the crook of his arm and trotted for the corvette. It was much the way he'd carried the redhead, Kira, in what now seemed the dim past.
the girl called. He heard the words and instantly discarded them as being of no importance under the present circumstances.
Daniel's reason for carrying his signals officer was quite simple. Adele had to be on the bridge when Commodore Pettin came aboard. Woetjans wasn't going to pass Pettin's standards of Ready for Duty, though the bosun would have the liquor bottles hidden and other evidence of good-fellowship out of the way.
Woetjans's taste ran to men who could make her look frail, though like most spacers she'd make do with what was available after a voyage like the past one. Daniel fleetingly wondered how lucky she'd been here on Sexburga.
Though, by the living God! absolutely nothing harmful to the good order of the RCN was going on here. The problem was that Commodore Pettin wouldn't see it that way; and thank God&#151;thank Admiral Anston&#151;for an experienced crew which could react to changed circumstances without the captain's orders.
Barnes and Inescu were on guard at the main hatchway. They'd managed to get to their feet and lift the stocked impellers they'd been issued for the duty. Inescu called cheerfully as Daniel pounded over the narrow gangplank with Adele in his arms.
It was a tossup in Daniel's mind whether Pettin would be more infuriated by a drunken officer of the watch or by one who was soaking wet from falling into the harbor in her haste to board. Adele was a solid weight, tall and not as slender as she looked from a distance. She didn't speak and held herself as stiff as a balance pole. Daniel suspected she didn't understand what was going on, but early in her contact with the RCN she'd learned how to keep from getting in the way in a crisis.
Daniel saw three earthenware jugs floating between the corvette's hull and the starboard outrigger. Barnes also noticed them and leaned over the hatchway, pointing his impeller.
Daniel shouted over the howl of the Winckelmann's car landing on the quay beside the redhead's. Barnes was too drunkenly focused to hear anything. He squeezed the trigger&#151;
WhackWHOCK&nbsp;
&#151;and the weapon spat a fifty-grain pellet of osmium into the water at five times the speed of sound.
Daniel half-turned, trying to shield Adele, but the waterspout was thirty feet high and drenched both of them. There were bits of shattered pottery in with the froth and flotsam. Daniel couldn't say much for Barnes's judgment, but he shot straight despite being pie-eyed drunk.
Daniel set Adele onto the Princess Cecile's entryway. Barnes blinked in horror at what he'd done. he mumbled. He lowered the impeller's muzzle so that it pointed at Daniel's feet instead of in line with his belt buckle.
Adele headed for the bridge without further direction. The soles of all RCN footgear, even the shiny half-boots Daniel wore with his whites, were of high-hysteresis rubber that gripped wet or dry. Adele squelched with each step, but she didn't fall down.
Daniel took the impeller from Barnes, switched the power off so that the coils couldn't accelerate another slug&#151;into the harbor, into Daniel himself, or into God knew where&#151;and returned it to the spacer. He could hear shouts echoing through the corvette as crewmen faced the sudden emergency.
Daniel said quietly. Though that possibility had a degree of attraction just at this moment.
Daniel turned and braced himself to attention, facing the three RCN officers and the sergeant of marines tramping down the gangplank. Captain, acting Commodore, Josip Pettin was in the lead. He was a lean, white-haired man, fifty but looking older. Normally his face would merely have been pale, but at this moment Pettin was so angry that his expression could have been carved from sun-dried bone.
Daniel saluted. He'd never managed anything so crisp during his years at the Academy. He might as well have mooned the commodore for all the good it seemed to do.
Daniel said. Commodore Pettin said, his nostrils flaring as though he detected a horrible stench. Maybe he did: even Daniel noticed Barnes's breath, and it wasn't that there was no alcohol on his own. Oh, God, that had torn it. No wonder Pettin looked mad enough to gnaw a junior lieutenant down to his boots.
The officers with Pettin were a plump, worried-looking commander&#151;probably the Winckelmann's executive officer&#151;and a lugubrious young woman with the single collar flash of a midshipman detailed as an aide with the rank of acting lieutenant. The sergeant of marines was just that&#151;and it was instructive that Pettin hadn't brought a marine officer instead. This was a burly fellow whose nightstick had gotten real use in the past.
Daniel said, his eyes unblinkingly focused on the center of the hatch instead of meeting the commodore's glaring fury. It wasn't much of a lie, and it seemed for a moment that it might just calm Pettin's anger. Then&#151;
Oh God. Kira whatever-her-name-is was trotting primly down the gangplank. The skintight skirt didn't hobble her in the least.
she called in a voice so clear that nobody within fifty feet could mistake the words. The quartet from the Winckelmann turned. The marine's face showed momentary appreciation, then went professionally blank. Commodore Pettin looked at Daniel again.
he said. His voice started gently enough but it quickly rose to be heard over the howl of another aircar landing. The vehicle was ornate, with enamel escutcheons on the doors and a fringed canopy.
Kira peeped. Even she seemed to have come to the realization that something was wrong.
The Princess Cecile's crew&#151;the bulk of the spacers who hadn't had time to scramble aboard before the commodore's aircar arrived&#151;had formed in ranks on the quay as though for an inspection. Through them, moving with the stumping precision of a man who'd spent his time in a starship's rigging, came Admiral Torgis with civilian aides in his train.
the commodore shouted.
said Daniel. It was reflex, drilled into him at the Academy and absolutely the only thing to say under these circumstances. boomed Admiral Torgis. Commodore Pettin said, half turning and forcing his face in the direction of a smile; not very far in that direction. He gestured toward the depot ship, a little flick of his hand as though trying to brush away a fly. His subordinates had stepped aside and stood at parade rest, studiously not looking at either the commodore or the admiral.
Kira vacillated on the gangplank. Torgis took the girl by the waist in both hands and swung her behind him, showing skill and balance that a rigger could appreciate.
he said with a chuckle. Daniel noted a hard glint in the admiral's eyes, though: he knew exactly what had been going on when he arrived here and what would have happened if he'd been a few minutes later. Pettin said, swaying slightly with the tension he held himself under. Torgis said. He stepped into the Princess Cecile's entryway, pressing the Winckelmann's personnel back by sheer force of personality. A second ship was descending; one of the squadron's destroyers, Daniel assumed, though he couldn't see from where he stood within the corvette. The thruster pulses were audible, though it would be some minutes before the sound smothered normal conversation.
Though didn't describe what was going on here.
Pettin said.
said Adele Mundy in a hard voice without a hint of respect in it. Daniel blinked in surprise, then choked back a laugh when he realized that Adele's statement was literally true. She stood ramrod straight on the companionway from C Level. She'd changed into her utility uniform, and he knew without question that the ship's log now would indicate she'd been on duty all night.
Pettin looked as though he'd been sandbagged. Admiral Torgis proved he understood as well as Woetjans did that the first rule of brawling is that you always kick your opponent when he's down.
the admiral said. Adele said in ringingly aristocratic tones, said Commodore Pettin. He shuddered like a man lifted from freezing water. His tongue touched his lips. He looked at Torgis and added in a voice that would have been venomous if it had more life, The destroyer was within three thousand feet, slowing to a near hover as the captain steadied her for landing. Admiral Torgis, raising his voice to be heard over the throb of plasma, said, Daniel had been standing at attention from the moment of the commodore's arrival. he said, throwing another salute. It wasn't nearly as crisp as the first; maybe despair was what he needed to perform drill and ceremony properly. Commodore Pettin turned and stalked off across the gangplank without returning the salute or further acknowledging the Resident Commissioner. His subordinates followed, each with a surreptitious salute to the former admiral.
The Princess Cecile's crew must have heard the entire exchange; now they began to cheer. They were so loud that Daniel could hear them until the destroyer licked the harbor into a roar of steam.
The cheering wasn't going to help matters tomorrow morning; but even before there hadn't been much doubt about how Daniel's formal interview would go.

CHAPTER FIFTEEN
Commodore Pettin called through the open hatchway to his office.
Daniel took two strides and halted before Pettin's desk. He was well aware of the three clerks in the outer office, staring at his back, but Pettin continued working at the holographic display between him and the lieutenant he'd summoned.
Daniel took an Academy brace and saluted. he said.
Pettin thumbed the display to lower intensity and looked through it sourly. He touched his forehead in a perfunctory salute and said, Daniel stepped sideways to parade rest, keeping his eye on the corner of the holoprint of a vaulted cloister behind the commodore. It was the only portion of the compartment's furnishings that wasn't RCN issue. Granting that Pettin wasn't a wealthy man, this was still an unusual degree of asceticism in an officer of his seniority.
the commodore continued. Pettin was wearing a utility uniform, technically acceptable since he was aboard a warship on active duty but a studied insult when welcoming the captain of a vessel recently posted to his command. Daniel had finally settled on his grays for the interview, knowing that whatever choice he made would be grounds to damn him&#151;for a popinjay in a dress uniform or because his utilities lacked respect for his superior officer&#151;if Pettin chose to take it that way.
As Pettin certainly was going to do.
Pettin asked, raising an eyebrow.
Daniel said to the cloisters.
With the exception of astrogation&#151;and there because of his skill in practice rather than on theory&#151;Daniel's Academy scores had been toward the lower limit of adequate. Even that degree of success probably owed less to Daniel's efforts than to the fact that a naval career didn't appeal to many grinding intellectuals. Still, there was more to being an RCN officer than your academic record.
But to protest to Pettin now? Daniel Leary had made a fool out of himself many times, and not always over a woman; but he'd never been so great a fool as that.
Pettin continued, looking vaguely displeased at Daniel's lack of reaction, Pettin raised his eyebrow again. It was hard to distinguish the expression from a scowl, but Daniel decided a response was the better choice. he said.
He'd wrung the Princess Cecile out, no question about that, but she'd come through the test with flying colors. Parts of the rigging needed replacement, and one of the triply-redundant pumps feeding the antimatter converters had lost its impeller in spectacular fashion, but all this would be classed as normal wear and tear for a run of such length.
With the exception of a turnbuckle that wasn't in store on Sexburga, the repairs were already complete. Tally and her assistant were machining that last part out of bar stock; they'd have it in place by mid-afternoon.
Pettin said with heavy irony. He paused with an expectant smirk.
Daniel said. The aircar he'd seen in the Captal's compound would hold twenty people, but there'd be gear to carry as well. He'd take ten crewmen plus Hogg&#151;a worthy scion of generations of poachers and outsdoorsmen&#151;and Adele if she wanted to go.
Disappointed again, Pettin continued, Daniel said. In the RCN, carrying out a superior's order always took precedence to wondering why the sanctimonious jackass had chosen to give the order in the first place.
the commodore said, leaning back in his chair as his fingers writhed on the desk before him. Daniel said to the hologram. Commodore Pettin said.
Daniel saluted, turned, and strode out of the office as smartly as he could manage. To his back Pettin shouted, He could have saved his breath. Daniel hadn't been in the least doubt about the commodore's opinion.
* * *
The bustle around Adele on the Princess Cecile's bridge hadn't penetrated her concentration, but when Daniel appeared, still shouting orders back down the companionway, she looked up from her console. Daniel already had the jacket of his 2nd Class uniform off and was unsealing the fly of his trousers to drop them also.
he said. A sidebar showed that Lt. Mon was in the Battle Direction Center, alerting the crewmen who'd be accompanying Daniel to the middle of nowhere. A few of them might start out with a hangover, but they were all present and accounted for. Daniel hadn't known what was going to happen when he formally reported to Commodore Pettin, but he'd made sure he and his whole complement would be prepared for it.
Adele said. With Tovera's help, Hogg had finished packing duffle bags for himself and Daniel. Unasked he traded Daniel a utility jacket for the grays. As he did so, the kneeling Tovera slid Daniel's trousers down and tapped his ankle for him to raise his right foot. She gave Adele a sidelong smile.
Daniel said. Adele said, half smug and half peeved at being told to do something that had been obvious to her from the moment Daniel called in as he left the Winckelmann. he said, now lifting his left foot as directed to step out of his trousers. At the open arms locker down the corridor, Sun handed impellers or submachine guns to the spacers told off for the expedition. His assistant, Gansevoort, ran the recipients' ID chips through a reader that paired them with the weapon serial numbers.
Adele's wands refocused her holographic display so that Daniel could view it from where he stood. Tovera was pulling the leg of his utility trousers over his right boot. Daniel said with an austerity that was not quite a rebuke. He switched legs while his hands did up the buttons&#151;more rugged, weather resistant, and silent than any other closure system&#151;of his jacket.
Adele considered what had just happened. Daniel thought her gesture was a way of saying, He was quite possibly correct. Both he and the situation demanded better performance from her.
Adele said, readjusting the display. Daniel asked with a frown of puzzlement. Tovera was buttoning his trousers.
Adele said. Daniel grinned and shook his head. Hogg, who already wore a stocked impeller slung muzzle-down over his right shoulder, handed Daniel an equipment belt complete with a holstered pistol.
Adele resumed. The Sexburgan day, slightly longer than that of Cinnabar, was brought into alignment by adding an intercalary eighty-one minutes to the ship's clock at midnight. She wasn't sure how to describe the admiral's intervention, so she gave a shrug that didn't affect the angle at which she held her wands.
Daniel said as he buckled the equipment belt around him. Adele said. She paused, then instead of paraphrasing quoted, She was quite certain that Gerson was simply being paranoid rather than that he really believed anyone could hear the message. This was a case where paranoia had paid off.
Two hours and fifty-one minutes later, but Adele had learned overprecision tended to bother those she spoke to. forty-three Daniel said quietly. Now dressed for action, he sat at his console and looked over the changes Lt. Mon had made in the watch roster to reflect the personnel going off to South Land for three days.
Sun said to the spacers he'd just armed. He'd be acting as Daniel's second in command so he had every right to order them out, but Adele knew that the shout&#151;which had startled her&#151;was meant to alert Daniel to the detachment's readiness.
The ten crewmen trotted toward the companionway, carrying in one hand the weapons they'd just been issued and the small pack holding toiletries and a change of clothes in the other. RCN crews were frequently used for detached security and fatigue duties on distant worlds where no other Cinnabar personnel were available, so there was a Standard Operating Procedure for it. Adele doubted whether often meant a dozen people being put in the middle of a desert over a thousand miles from their ship, though.
Daniel looked up to see Sun, the last in line, heading down toward the quay. Pasternak was coming up from the power room, using the other companionway. He looked worried, but Adele knew by now that was the engineer's normal expression.
Daniel said to Adele and to Banks, waiting silently at the attack console although he was technically off duty at the moment. Adele said. Daniel said. His face twitched as if he were trying to suppress a smile. Then he said, Adele shrugged again. she said. Pasternak entered the bridge; Lt. Mon was coming down the corridor from the Battle Direction Center. Betts got to his feet. Daniel rose from his console also, to take his leave of his officers before joining the detachment on the quay.
he said, flashing Adele a boyish grin. Adele said aloud. Her mind added, And one way or another, I'm going to learn.&nbsp;

CHAPTER SIXTEEN
The aircar's central compartment had luxury seating for eight. Sun, Vesey, and the eight ordinary crewmen found it uncomfortably roomy: spacers liked close quarters or they'd have found some other line of work. The rear compartment had jumpseats for servants as well as cargo tie-downs; the expedition's food and luggage rode there now.
Daniel and Hogg were on either end of the bench seat in front, sandwiching their driver/guide Dorotige, the attendant Daniel had met guarding the Captal's gate. Today he wore a gray jacket over loose khaki trousers instead of the clown suit he'd been in for the party.
Dorotige said, shouting over the sound of wind and the fans' vibration. The central compartment was slung in elastic to isolate the passengers from the noise of operation, but the driver had no such luxury. Daniel said, looking down at a plain broken by ravines where russet vegetation found enough moisture to grow. In the forward distance rose sandstone hills which the wind had weathered out of the surrounding clay. In truth, Daniel's only real concern about the expedition was the same one the Captal's man had voiced. The spacers weren't for the most part any more familiar with hand weapons than they were with camping in the middle of a barren desert. Even though he'd ordered them to leave the guns' power switches off, there was a real chance that somebody'd put a bullet through himself, a fellow, or the car's drive fans.
Hogg said. Hogg was quite capable of exaggeration. He was also capable of cutting somebody's throat. Daniel hoped the comment was in the former category, but he even more hoped that he'd never have to learn.
An intercom connected the vehicle's three compartments, but Sun used his helmet's unit channel to ask, Daniel said, flipping down his visor and cueing the geographical overlay. It didn't show what he expected it to. Frowning, he used the thumb dial under his left ear to increase the scale until the destination pip showed on the same screen as the point where the helmet's inertial navigation system placed the aircar. They were to the north of the plotted ruins and well inland of them as well.
Daniel said without raising his voice more than the noise level required. Hogg must have heard something in the tone, because he reached into his pocket.
Dorotige muttered.
There was a snick from Hogg's side of the compartment. Hogg said. He didn't speak loudly either, but with the point of a seven-inch knife blade resting against Dorotige's throat, he didn't have to.
Dorotige screamed. The aircar lurched sideways. If Hogg hadn't been very fast, the jolt would have done exactly what the driver was afraid of; but while you could fault Hogg's judgment occasionally, Daniel was pretty sure his servant would never kill anybody that he didn't mean to. He had the knife back and closed before Dorotige managed to spit himself on it.
Daniel steadied the control yoke with his left hand, bringing the car straight and level again. He said, the driver shouted, angry and terrified at the same time. He pointed through the windscreen toward the ground five hundred feet below. The sound of Hogg's knife reopening punctuated the driver's bluster. He choked the next word off in his throat.
Daniel grimaced. He could see a pattern of lines in the stone, but until he dialed up the magnification on his visor they looked like mere weathering. That still might be what they were, but at 40x magnification and with the helmet's optical stabilizer engaged, Daniel could tell they were straight or at least seemed straight.
Dorotige said, now in a tone of injured innocence that Daniel had to admit his right to. Daniel said. He glanced into the passenger compartment. The helmet communicator was still engaged so the crewmen had heard everything that was going on. Dasi had his impeller pointed at the back of the driver's head. The heavy slug would punch through the clear plastic without difficulty, true enough, but it'd also send fragments of the panel across the compartment like a grenade blast.
Daniel frowned and waved the weapon away. He said, He felt uncomfortable, but that might be simply because he seemed to have made a fool of himself. Still, the Captal should have mentioned that he'd directed them to a site that wasn't . . .
Ah. The Captal might not even know what the RCN Sailing Directions said about South Land. Anyway, there was no way of telling what the Captal had said to Gerson or Gerson to Commodore Pettin during their interview.
Daniel said, sitting formally upright. Hogg said, Dorotige brought the aircar to a hover, raising a huge doughnut of red dust from the spiky vegetation. The cloud was inevitable, but he let the vehicle slip backward and landed expertly out of the worst of it.
Daniel opened his door; he'd studied the odd pull-lift motion of the latch before they left Spires. He'd learned as a child stuck in a narrowing cave that he didn't want to get into anything where he didn't know the way out.
Hogg stepped onto the deck on his side and surveyed the landscape: dark red rock with horizontal striations where the wind had dug deeper between layers; a sky so pale it was almost white; and cushions of reddish grass an inch or two high and about a foot in diameter. The vegetation vanished into the general rocky undersurface from any distance in the air, except in the ravines where greater moisture and protection from the wind let it grow higher.
Hogg spat. he said. He turned to glare at Daniel over the cabin of the car. he added, Daniel said, stepping to the ground. The contact jolted him all the way from his heel right up the spinal column. For some reason sandstone felt harder than other kinds of rock, even granite and basalt.
Sun ordered, lifting the gate of the cargo compartment. That was true beyond doubt. Maybe it was a whim of the weather rather than a variation in climate, but the air here was ten degrees cooler than it had been on Spires when they left this morning. This site was far from the coast, which probably made a difference also. And speaking of the site&#151;
Daniel said. There was high-definition imaging equipment in the kit Adele's servant, Tovera, had packed for the expedition, but for Daniel's initial survey his helmet's recording capacity would be sufficient. Dorotige muttered as he slid across the seat. Patterns that Daniel had taken for mineral deposits on the rock were actually the stems of woody plants. They crawled across the surface because the wind would shear them if they rose any distance in the air. Their purplish leaves were as tiny as grains of rice.
Dorotige said, waving toward the hillside. He started up the slope. His foot slipped on bare stone; from then on he stepped on the flat mounds of grass that gave him some traction. He was wearing soft-soled sandals better suited for a drawing room than a wilderness.
Daniel thought about how long it must take plants to grow in this windswept aridity but didn't say anything to Dorotige. Besides, only the outer rim of the cushions was still alive; the centers were coarse gray stems.
said Dorotige, pointing to his feet. Hogg said. He spat again, grimacing as the wind blew the gobbet back just short of his boot.
Daniel squatted beside the indentation in the rock, hoping to find some reason to disagree. He couldn't come up with one immediately.
So: there was a trough in the sandstone. It was straight, true enough, but it never got deeper than his index finger and its margins were rounded. Eight feet up it crossed another trough, shallower yet, at right angles. When Daniel held his head low to the ground he could make out a whole network of the markings, just as Dorotige had said.
Daniel offered. The patterns had been easier to see from the air, because the shadows thrown by the indentations were more obvious than the grooves themselves.
Hogg said. His education had been practical rather than scholarly, but there was very little new about the countryside an academic would be able to tell Hogg. His boot pointed to&#151;but didn't touch&#151;a shrub growing where troughs joined, its four stems writhing up the intersecting lines. Dorotige said. He stalked off, rubbing his hands together. Daniel ignored him, so Hogg merely shrugged.
Sun had the aircar emptied; Vesey was leading a section with buckets and shovels into the nearest ravine, searching for the water that was supposed to be there. They'd brought three days' supply in jerricans, but it'd be nice to have extra so they could wash.
Daniel stood, feeling momentarily dizzy. Squatting had cut off the circulation in his legs, robbing his brain of blood when he rose too quickly.
he said. The aircar's drive fans whined, spinning up from idle; Dorotige hadn't shut the motors down when he landed. Daniel turned, frowning slightly. Sun and the other spacers were nearer to the vehicle, but they were upwind and probably didn't notice.
Daniel said, the name cueing his direct channel to the warrant officer. Dorotige slammed full power to his fans, sending the aircar downslope in a spray of grit. He kept it sliding only a handsbreadth above the ground so that surface effect supported the vehicle and as much power as possible went to accelerating its mass. The spacers shouted angrily, shielding their eyes as the car passed.
Hogg rolled his impeller's butt to his shoulder. His left hand gripped the fore-end while his arm stressed the sling to provide two more contact points locking the weapon on target.
Daniel said. He knocked the impeller up with the edge of his hand.
The weapon's whack! punctured only the empty sky. The hairs on Daniel's arm stood out straight; the pellet's aluminum driving skirt, ionized by the flux through the barrel's coil windings, quivered like a blob of rainbow in front of the muzzle.
When Hogg's shot crashed out, Barnes and Keast opened up with their submachine guns. If they'd heard Daniel's shout (which wasn't certain against the wind), they ignored it in favor of the direct appeal of somebody else shooting.
Daniel saw two sparkles from the vehicle's quarter panel where ten-grain pellets disintegrated against the dense structural plastic. A swatch of hillside fifty meters from the car erupted in miniature dust devils. If the guard&#151;no way to tell which one&#151;had missed the same distance to the left instead of right, he'd have laced his burst into fellow spacers scrambling for their stacked weapons.
Hogg, his face as dark and stiff as an old boot, lowered the weapon across his chest in a carry position. He didn't look at Daniel.
Daniel bellowed on the unit push. He spread his feet and stood arms akimbo, hoping to dominate the situation by example since he was too far from the others to interfere the way he had with Hogg.
The aircar dipped behind a knoll too low to notice in the ordinary course of events. Daniel could still track the vehicle by the line of dust rising in a dull red haze.
Hogg said in a tight voice, still refusing to look at his master. Daniel said quietly. Hogg snarled. They started toward Sun and the others. Vesey and her team appeared at the lip of the ravine. The midshipman's pistol, the only weapon among the four of them, was in her hand.
A mile from the site he'd marooned the Cinnabar spacers, Dorotige lifted the aircar from the nap of the earth. It was a black dot against the pale sky. Hogg paused.
he said. said Daniel. Hogg muttered, but he knew it wasn't an argument he'd win with his master. He didn't push beyond the bare comment.
Daniel could be as ruthless as was necessary to safeguard his mission and his crew. If he didn't care to kill for no better reason than anger, though . . . well, that was his business. There was nobody on South Land to overrule him.
Sun already had the satellite radio out when Daniel and Hogg reached the intended campsite. It was part of the gear the Captal had supplied with the aircar and driver. Adele could have adapted one of the corvette's own units, but it was simpler to borrow a radio keyed to the planetary frequencies.
Sun said miserably. Daniel said. A wry smile lighted his face. He glanced around the semicircle of his subordinates. They straightened and tried to look unconcerned as they met his eyes, all but Barnes. The big man had turned his back shamefacedly as he reloaded the submachine gun he'd emptied without&#151;or against&#151;orders.
Daniel said. He saw his subordinates through the mask of the terrain display projected onto the inner surface of his visor. To keep Daniel himself; though he couldn't imagine why. The rest of the party were top spacers, but the Princess Cecile could certainly operate without them.
Though Daniel for one would have to be damned hungry to get up an appetite for lichen soup.
he said. The midshipman looked down in horror at the pistol she still held. In squeaky embarrassment she said, Daniel said. He deliberately turned his head so that Vesey could holster her weapon out of his sight.
Daniel resumed, Daniel felt a grin form at the corners of his mouth. That provided a good reason not to shoot down the Captal's aircar, though he knew his decision had nothing to do with reason.
he continued, He grinned more broadly. He didn't even know who they were with certainty.
Daniel said, said Sun, looking cheerful for the first time since he'd found the radio was dead. His training to repair electromotive weapons as armorer gave him more hands-on skill with electronics than Daniel and Vesey had gotten at the Academy.
Daniel looked at the sky. The sun was midway to the western horizon. he said, Sun asked.
Daniel looked at Hogg and raised an eyebrow. Hogg rubbed his mouth with a knuckle, considering the spacers. he said. He looked at Daniel and raised an eyebrow in turn.
Daniel unsnapped his pistol, holster and all, and laid it on the rocks at his feet. he said. Hogg said in a musing, almost cheerful, tone. * * *
From context, that had to be not Adele adjusted the character recognition parameters on her personal data unit, then used it to rescan the document's obverse. The machine whirred softly as it worked.
Adele stretched, wondering how long she'd been here in the attic of the Civil Government Building. The museum and library in the basement would have been a disappointment if she'd had any real expectations. She'd gotten a feeling she couldn't have explained when the museum's volunteer director, a retired ship chandler, mentioned the dead storage for items that weren't worth displaying, however.
Felt the thrill of the chase, Adele supposed. She visualized Hogg beside her in the dimness, waiting in perfect silence for prey to step into his sight picture. The thought made her smile, but there was truth in it nonetheless: every line of work has its tricks, and the people who know their craft very well always have an instinct that goes beyond the available evidence.
The data unit's display suddenly changed from opalescence to projected text. Moments before, about twenty percent of the document had been garbage; now less than half of that amount remained as a blur beyond analysis and reconstruction.
&nbsp;
THE DAY AFTER THE DEATH OF CAPTAIN TYRFING, I LEFT THE CAMP AND PROCEEDED NORTH AS BEST I COULD JUDGE BY THE SUN. ANY NAVIGATIONAL MATERIALS FOR THIS GODFORSAKEN PLACE HAD PERISHED WITH THE SHIP'S COMPUTER DURING THE CRASH. . . .
The attic was musty, which was actually a good thing from the standpoint of this document's survival. It was written on leather, and now that she'd read much of it Adele had begun to wonder about the source of that leather. The ink came from the berries of what the writer called the Finger Bush. Adele couldn't match the writer's cursory description . . . THE HEIGHT OF MY FOREARM, WITH BRANCHES LIKE FINGERS AND FRUITS OF A SULLEN YELLOW ON THE TIPS THEREOF . . . with any plant in her database, but she knew she wasn't competent to direct the search for botanical answers.
The attic had a line of resistance lights in the ceiling, but the only two still working were on the far side of the big room. That didn't matter enough for Adele to get the bulbs replaced since she had a handlight and the data unit's display was self-illuminating. It did mean that when someone's body filled the square opening of the trapdoor, the dimming light attracted her attention as the squeaking of the ladder moments before had not.
Adele jerked suddenly alert, her left hand slipping down to the pistol in her pocket. That wasn't a reflex I used to have. . . .&nbsp;
she said in a carrying voice.
Dorst called. Adele said, knowing that she was being snappish because of the way she'd reacted to the surprise. The midshipman climbed the last three steps and squatted down to face her. His head would clear the ceiling if he kept it between the rafters, but then he couldn't look at Adele.
Dorst said. Adele said, wondering how she felt at the news. Her normal reaction was to shut down all emotion so that it didn't get in the way of accurate analysis. That was still the correct reaction, but this time it felt . . . odd. Dorst said, straightening abruptly and thumping his head into a beam of reinforced concrete. He winced and stumbled forward, then knelt on one knee so he could keep his spine stiff while facing Adele.
he said. Adele had already suspended the document analysis and was checking message traffic. Rather than looking at communications addressed to the Princess Cecile&#151;the on-duty personnel were certainly capable of having done that&#151;she coded her search for the time the comsats of Sexburga's low-orbit constellation were over South Land. It was just possible that a message had been received by a satellite which had failed to pass it on, or that&#151;through some electronic hiccup between the local system and the corvette&#151;the central communications node had swallowed the information.
The individual satellite logs showed no private messages coming out of South Land. The continuous broadcast from the navigation beacon on the northern headland was logged, providing Adele with proof that the satellites were working properly.
She paged Tovera through the transponder on the corvette&#151;Meet me at the ship ASAP&#151;then shut down her personal data unit and stood. The attic's contents were a shadowed jumble about her. Early on somebody had made an attempt to keep this overflow organized, but for the past several decades&#151;judging by the dates of the documents Adele had unearthed&#151;boxes had been piled on filing cabinets and into the aisles the initial planners had left.
She'd been working on a smooth-surfaced attach&eacute; case stacked on a packing crate of rubberized metal. She put away the data unit, then paused as she considered what to do with the document she'd found in a drawer of pre-Hiatus logbooks.
Dorst asked, reaching forward as he spoke. Adele said, then frowned at herself. Though he had to learn to ask before he put his hands on things . . .
she continued to the midshipman, ramrod straight though still on his knee, Adele frowned again. she added, because you could scarcely consider this unimpeachable evidence.
Dorst said, leaning far over to bring his eyes closer to the document. He clasped his hands behind his back to show that there was no danger of him touching the leather. Adele smiled. she said, Dorst said as his mind finally realized that he was seeing the attach&eacute; case, not pale gray ink against the dark brown leather. He looked up at Adele in amazement.
she said dryly. A document like this deserved care beyond anything available on Sexburga, but that couldn't be Adele's present priority. She opened the acetate folder she'd found it in and slipped one edge under the fragile wondrousness of the memoir. Closing the folder, she put the document back into the drawer where it had been.
It had survived there for decades or more. If matters worked out the way Adele hoped they would, she could return and preserve the account properly. If not, she didn't suppose it mattered very much.
She gestured Dorst to the opening. she said crisply.
he said, rising to a stoop, Adele said, squeezing past the midshipman. He'd spoken as though he'd been watching her sway as she worked the stiff bolt to open the attic. Well, you didn't have to be around Officer Mundy very long to imagine how clumsy she'd be on a ladder.
Dorst said, gripping her arm in a tactful but firm fashion. Adele said, supplying the correct word as she obediently turned and started down. Though falling fifteen feet onto her face&#151;the Council Chamber was on this floor and the ceiling was high&#151;would certainly be uncomfortable.
Dorst waited till she'd reached the hallway to follow. He slammed the trapdoor with no trouble: the sudden weight had almost swept Adele off the ladder when the bolt released it.
he said, dropping lightly onto the balls of his feet instead of climbing down the rungs.
He smiled in a hopeful, puppyish way. Adele realized that he was trying to change the unstated subject from her physical ineptitude. That was the sort of handicap that bothered people who didn't trip over themselves more than it did Adele herself, but she found the impulse engaging.
Adele said, striding briskly down the hallway. Dorst glanced back at the tall step ladder, but Adele waved him on. The janitor had dragged the ladder out for her with bad grace despite the generous tip she'd given him; he could put it away or leave it in the middle of the corridor as he chose.
she resumed as she started down the end stairs, A group of Sexburgans chattering in accented Universal were coming up in a cluster around a woman so pale that Adele would have guessed she was an albino, except that her eyes were an icy gray-blue. The Sexburgans all watched the pale woman, but her eyes followed Dorst until she disappeared through the door onto the second floor.
Dorst said. The outside door was stiff; it resisted Adele until the midshipman hit it, high and low with his palm and bootsole. Adele said. Insufficient data could cause mistakes. Certainty about matters where the data were insufficient was a mistake on its face. The streets of Spires weren't lighted, and the sky was dark except for the stars. They were unfamiliar constellations in a manner of speaking, but Adele didn't know anything about the stars above Cinnabar either. She was a city dweller, and if she'd ever been interested in the night sky she'd have called up a computer projection of it.
Dorst said, falling abreast as they started up the street. A ship took off from the harbor. Adele lowered her eyes, shielding them further with her hand as she waited for the plasma's artificial thunder to subside.
Dorst slipped his goggles into place, watching the liftoff as he strode along. he shouted. Adele said, going back to the previous question. Percussion bands were playing at the upper and lower ends of the street, the tunes syncopating one another. Because Adele was unfamiliar with the local instrumentation, it took her a moment to realize that the counterpoint wasn't intended. The Strymonian yacht had shrunk to an unusually bright star in the heavens.
she added, Dorst looked at her. She shrugged and grinned. Adele said. &nbsp;

CHAPTER SEVENTEEN
The windblown grit didn't scratch the moissanite visors pro- tecting the faces of the detachment, but bare skin&#151;the backs of Daniel's hands and his throat above his collar&#151;already felt as though it was sunburned. What was it going to be like a week from now?
Daniel grinned broadly. Well, that was something he could wait a week to learn. Any number of things could happen before then to render present concern empty. Some of the possibilities were even survivable.
he said to key the general channel. Daniel took his knapsack off and waited as the crewmen slid over the crumbling bank. The region must get some rain for this dry riverbed and its contributory ravines to exist, but rain must be very infrequent. The hard-stemmed bushes growing to the level of the bank were at least several years old; a downpour as fierce as the ones that had excavated the riverbed would uproot any vegetation present at the time.
When Daniel himself stepped down, the sudden absence of wind was as great a relief as warm shelter after a blizzard. He hadn't appreciated just how enervating the wind's cutting pressure was until he'd escaped it&#151;for a time.
Hogg was giving orders in a voice that remained clear despite obvious wear from the dust and dryness. They'd all been drinking their fill in expectation of replenishing their water supply, but the mucous membranes of noses and mouths still suffered in this damnable atmosphere.
Sun croaked. If the gunner had wanted information instead of a reason to speak to Daniel, he'd have read the figure off his helmet's navigation display. He was working his arms alternately to loosen them after the pull of his packstraps, switching the powerful impeller from hand to hand so that he wasn't flailing it around.
Daniel said. Sun said, rubbing his mouth with the back of his free hand. He was a wiry man of middle height, and one of the solidest of the Princess Cecile's crew&#151;under normal circumstances. He'd obviously already looked at his map overlay. It would have showed him that the dry river entered the Middle Sea within ten miles of the cape where the beacon was set.
Daniel said truthfully, He gestured, calling attention to the brush around them. Daniel could differentiate at least a dozen species, though they all had smooth trunks and small, oval leaves. Several varieties had foliage covered with fine spines, even though Sexburga had no large herbivores. Daniel had seen that sort of adaptation before in desert climates: the spines created a zone of still air so that constant wind didn't dry the plant out faster than the roots could replenish its fluids.
The armed leaves would nonetheless lacerate anybody moving through them quickly. Besides, the trunks of neighboring bushes twisted around one another in a slow-motion attempt to wrestle more of their valuable riverbed real estate.
Sun looked at the vegetation and sighed. he said. He turned and walked back to where his men had cleared a tent-sized area under Hogg's direction. The detachment had only one powered cutting bar, though Hogg had sharpened the two shovels on a rock slab at the landing site. They'd come here to view what might be foundations carved into bare rock, not to hack through the continent's rare stretches of vegetation.
Daniel didn't let the concern he felt for Sun reach his face. The constant wind was unpleasant to anybody, but the gunner's reaction was just short of phobia. It wasn't the sort of problem that would arise aboard a starship.
And there wasn't a thing to do about it now.
The fire's dense yellow flames crackled, throwing heat even to where Daniel stood twenty feet away. This South Land brushwood burned with an oily intensity, but Dasi and Pring had been unable to light it until Hogg feathered one of the chopped stems with his knife before touching the lighter to it.
Hogg sauntered over, smiling with satisfaction at a job well done&#151;and also, if Daniel knew his servant, at his superiority to a bunch of city folk. Hogg asked. Daniel said, feeling a touch of excitement that took him back to his boyhood. That was the way Hogg always prefaced a chance to view a part of nature that almost no one ever saw. There'd been the day the crystal moths issued from every pore of a tree their grub forms had eaten hollow, mating in the sunlight they saw only once in thirty years; the cave under the sea cliff, always in the past empty, from which the scaly head of leviathan rose one evening to follow the line of Hogg's low-skimming aircar; the roc lifting as the sun woke updrafts from the hinterlands of Bantry . . .
Hogg picked up a shovel and handed the impeller to Barnes. he said. Barnes said with a grin. Hogg sniffed and gestured with his free hand for Daniel to follow him into the brush.
Hogg and the Sissies respected one another and had been through some tense times together. Both sides had a genial contempt for the group the other represented, however. Daniel had a foot in either camp. He found the mutual chauvinism amusing, since they'd shown that in a crisis they'd join ranks against a common enemy.
Hogg held the sharpened blade of the shovel out in front of him like a horseman's lance and duckwalked down a tunnel of branches growing from pedestals of dirt laced high by roots. The soil was so light and dry that even here in the riverbed the breezes carved it away except where something bound it.
Daniel's hands were empty, so he scrambled along on all fours. The knife on his equipment belt would make a satisfactory weapon at close quarters, but he saw no need to draw it now.
Hogg said, making room for Daniel by squeezing against a bush whose tiny white berries grew from the underside of its leaves. He pointed with the shovel; its broad tip had a wicked sheen where he'd stroked the metal to an edge.
He indicated a bush whose stems swelled at intervals into fist-sized nodules. They weren't the result of disease as Daniel had thought when he first viewed them, but rather reservoirs in which the plant stored a white, starchy substance. Daniel had tasted a pinch and found it flavorless but not apparently harmful. He'd thought of using it to supplement their diet if necessary.
Half this bush had been stripped: the stems cut a foot or two above the ground, then cut again to excise the nodules. The undamaged stems looked forlorn, springing from a base meant for twice their number.
Hogg said, Daniel flicked on his handlight. The sky was still bright enough for normal vision, but he needed more intensity to judge how fresh the cuts were. Bark curled resiliently under the pressure of his fingertip. He said, Hogg said. Daniel said. He didn't know what he believed, so he stated what seemed the most reasonable possibility. Hogg said. From his tone, he didn't know what he believed either. He resumed waddling forward, along the trail rubbed in the friable soil. The markings were faint, but even Daniel could have followed them; Hogg had another generation's worth of experience in woodcraft.
Fifteen feet ahead, he gestured to one of the chopped-out nodules, dropped beside the track. Daniel nodded.
Dasi asked through the helmet. The fact that it was a spacer checking rather than Sun, the petty officer in charge, was a bad sign. Daniel said, The trail had led them back to the wall of the dry channel. A block of sandstone the diameter of a dinnerplate projected from the bank. It didn't look as though it belonged there. Hogg tested it with the heel of his left hand, leaning some, then all of his weight against it. he commented.
Daniel grimaced. he said. Hogg eyed the neighboring brush. He chose a plant, then notched its stem with his shovel and stripped a line of bark up from the cut. It was as tough and flexible as rawhide. he said. Daniel chuckled. he said. * * *
Adele worked at the seven separate screens on her display while Tovera stood behind her chair, facing toward the bridge proper. The servant wore, unusually for her, an RCN commo helmet. She was echoing Adele's display on the visor.
Lt. Mon said. He slammed his fist on the command console and stood. Adele locked her display and set her wands on the flat surface. She rotated her seat to face Mon, but she was rubbing her eyes instead of meeting his furious gaze.
Mon said. A part of Adele wondered idly whether that was the sort of information that all RCN commanders thought they had to tell their signals officers. Whose console did Mon think the calls were routed through?
Aloud she said, She gestured toward the command console. Mon's face darkened for a moment; Adele realized that her brusqueness had tripped Mon's little-man belligerence. He nodded, remembering her civilian background, and sat down obediently.
Adele muttered, irritated with herself. If she'd been a man instead of a slender woman whose physical presence threatened no one, her error might have precipitated a scene in the current charged atmosphere.
She faced around and unlocked the display, saying, Her wand highlighted a movement log, culled from the compound's own sensors.
Mon said. He caught himself. he said with the controlled tension of a gymnast balancing.
said Adele, throwing up time-slugged imagery of the car landing in the courtyard. She split the display to show two versions of the vehicle's left quarter panel recorded when it left the compound and on its return. The quality wasn't good enough to show detail, but the fist-sized dents in the latter image were sufficiently clear.
Adele said. Mon said in a cold voice. For all the lieutenant's bubbling temper, he didn't bluster when there was a serious task in front of him. That was probably why Daniel liked having Mon as a subordinate.
Adele said. Mon's mouth opened, then closed. he said in a wondering voice, Adele said carefully. Put as baldly as Mon had, she realized that she should've been discussing matters with the acting captain at every step of the way. Mon touched the intercom key. When the attention call sounded, he said, Mon's words reached Adele through the helmet, through the air directly from his lips, and in a whispering echo from the ceiling speakers down the corridor. He gave her a smile as tight and sharp as the knots spun into a length of barbed wire.
Adele said apologetically. Mon said, Woetjans and Taley dropped through the dorsal hatch, reaching the bridge a half step before Betts arrived from his sleeping compartment in the warrant officers' quarters. Pasternak had been in the Battle Direction Center for some reason. He came running down the corridor, the crash of his boots warning curious crewmen out of his path.
Mon said. Betts sat at his console where he could import imagery from Adele's display, but the other officers would have to make do with their helmet visors.
Adele said, Tovera had gathered much of the background on her own, even before Daniel's disappearance created a need for it. She apparently liked to know the power structures wherever she was.
Mon said without raising his voice. He was tapping the index and middle fingers of his right hand into the opposite palm with the steady deliberation of a bell-ringer. Woetjans said.
An instant later all the other officers nodded. They must know as surely as Adele did that the Navy Office would have to treat any such overt violation as piracy, to be punished by the consequent hanging of the officers and crew of the offending vessel.
Adele said in a tone of cold disgust. It wouldn't necessarily be possible, either: the Captal had prepared defenses to meet just such an attack. Saying as much would only inflame the officers around her into an attitude of heroic self-sacrifice. The code A501 flashed in red at the upper margin of Adele's display. It wouldn't echo on the other displays and she'd toggled off the audio cue; no one knew about it but the Signals Officer. A502 would have meant the call was from squadron command; A501 meant&#151;
Adele locked her display and pointed a wand toward Lt. Mon. she said. She'd lost track of who was on watch; perhaps she herself was. Mon shook his head curtly and keyed his audio. he said without inflection. the speaker said. Adele might be reading irritation into Pettin's tone, but the man was certainly not above thundering angrily at any delay in getting the acting captain. Nor was he above regretting a chance to display that righteous indignation. Lt. Mon said. His face, always angular, changed shape as the muscles tightened over his jaw and cheekbones. RCN communications were normally voice-only to minimize bandwidth. That was fortunate in this case, because Mon wasn't a good actor. His voice stayed almost flat, but the fury toward the commodore in his expression could scarcely have been more obvious.
Pettin said. Mon said through clenched teeth. Pettin snarled, The transmission ended in an electronic click rather than the crash that Pettin obviously would have preferred if the technology permitted it. Adele smiled at the thought, then wiped her face blank lest Mon misunderstand her humor.
Woetjans said. Taley agreed, looking even more than usually as if she were following a coffin. Pasternak said. Mon said, his hands laced together so tightly that the fingertips raised white halos against the tanned backs. His face was savage. he repeated, but his voice had sunk to a growl.
said Adele. Her wands twitched, expanding an image to full-display size. * * *
The rattle of pebbles in empty ration cans wasn't loud thirty feet away from the tent, but it was so different from the wind's keening overhead that even before Hogg gripped his shoulder Daniel had awakened in a rush. He sat upright and slapped on the commo helmet, saying, Hogg rasped. His helmet would continue to broadcast on the unit push because he hadn't closed the transmission. That was actually a good idea to keep the crew informed of what was going on. It was simply sloppy procedure on Hogg's part, of course.
Daniel had slept in his boots, but he paused to slide the closures tight before stepping out of the warmth of the tent behind Hogg. Barnes rose onto one elbow; he'd be outside as soon as Daniel's eyes were off him, joining his friend Dasi on guard.
It was the guards, Dasi and Sentino, that Daniel had been warning; the other spacers remained asleep. Spacers on a long voyage learned to sleep through any amount of racket and crowding, unless it was their name or their watch that had been called.
Daniel dialed his visor's light enhancement up to daylight normal as he crawled along after Hogg. Sentino squatted near the head of the track, her impeller pointed up at a 45-degree angle to show that it didn't threaten anybody. She lifted her left index finger to acknowledge Daniel; he nodded as he passed her.
The creature in the trap ahead of them was screaming. The sound was high-pitched and as loud as a saw cutting stone. It almost completely drowned the rattling of the cans tied to the snare.
The track curved around a bush whose branches dropped runners to the ground, completely blocking Daniel's view of the camp&#151;and vice versa. When he was out of Sentino's sight, he drew his knife.
Hogg thrust the shovel into the base of a shrub with ghostly white stems, then lifted it with a twist of deceptively strong wrists. He flung the clump out of the way so that Daniel could squat beside him. Nobody whom Hogg had spanked would mistake him for a soft fellow beyond the curve of middle age.
Hogg had set his double noose snare over the mouth of the hole plugged by the sandstone block. The eighty-pound creature which had tripped the triggers now hung in the air, flailing in the grip of the pair of springy branches Hogg had used to tension the trap.
It was white and hairless except for bushes of red-gold hair in its armpits. It had four broad, stubby limbs and a neck so thick and powerfully muscled that the nooses which should have choked the creature unconscious by now merely served to suspend it. It gripped the right-hand tether with blunt claws, jangling the rattles Hogg had attached to the rig to warn him when he'd made a catch.
Hogg muttered, easing closer and cocking the shovel back for a thrust. Its broad blade would let the creature's life out faster than an explosive bullet. said Daniel. He put his hand on Hogg's right shoulder, emphasizing the warning. The creature's screams had turned to mewls as Hogg and Daniel came into sight. Its eyes were large and round, set in circuits of bone. When it closed them in terror, sheets of muscle rather than thin skin covered the orbs.
The noose gave way: untied from the springy branch, just as Hogg had said. The remaining noose flicked the creature sideways like the popper of a whip. From behind it looked like a grub worm, ugly beyond easy description. Daniel might have underestimated its weight because there was no hair to bulk up its form.
Hogg swore softly. The creature squirmed both forepaws under the bark cord and tugged outward. Interrogatory chirps were coming from the burrow; Daniel could see fairy lights deep within the ground.
Hogg said, poising the shovel again.
said Daniel.
The tensioned branch sprang back. In a reciprocal motion, the creature leaped for the opening and vanished within as smoothly as water swirling down a hole.
Hogg was breathing hard. He kept the shovel pointed at the burrow even after the sandstone plug thudded into the opening and was wedged into place with a series of clacks muted by the surrounding bank.
Hogg said. said Daniel. He turned and started back for the tent. He was panting too, though he hadn't been exerting himself.
Hogg said.
said Daniel. &nbsp;

CHAPTER EIGHTEEN
Hogg put his hand on Daniel's shoulder, pointed to the ravine ahead of them, and said, Daniel glanced toward the back of the line where Sun, as senior petty officer, should be marching to chivy in stragglers. He was there, all right, but little Vesey was guiding him along. Barnes walked alongside, carrying Sun's pack as well as his own.
Which Hogg had already noticed. Daniel ordered. The spacers were tired, but they broke into a jog and grinned as they passed Daniel and Hogg. Dasi took Sun's left arm and helped Vesey move the gunner's mate into a trot also. Sun's legs moved when prodded, but his eyes had no life in them.
Hogg murmured. Daniel looked at his rotund servant. he said. He followed Hogg down the bank, which sloped because wind had recently undercut the lip and dumped it as a scree of pebbles and adobe clay onto the base of the ravine. Midway he paused to survey the bank to either side, then went the rest of the way down. The crew had already chopped a small clearing in the brush so that they didn't have to hunch under arched branches.
Sentino sloshed water from the last of their three jerricans into a cup. The osmotic pump they'd set in the underground aquifer overnight had made up the seven or eight gallons they'd drunk from the original supply, but by mid-afternoon of this second day the spacers marching in dry air had absorbed ten gallons.
Sentino held the cup out to Daniel. she said. Rather than argue that he'd wait his turn&#151;and besides, he was thirsty&#151;Daniel took the cup and had it almost to his lips when the smell hit him. If he'd been out in the wind, he might have swallowed down most of the cup unawares, which would have been a great deal worse than going thirsty.
he said. Sun pushed Sentino aside and put his nose to the jerrican's wide mouth. He rose with a look of white rage. he shouted. His near stupor of moments before had passed. He picked up the jerrican by one of the paired handles on top and slung it a good twenty feet into the bushes. That was a remarkable throw for five gallons of water with the weight of the container.
Barnes explained softly. He and Dasi looked as miserable as Sun was angry. Dasi said. Stolen from Delos Vaughn's baggage, no doubt. One of which had been used for some petroleum product, probably extra kerosine for the fuel cells of the Winckelmann's big aircar; and hadn't been properly cleaned afterwards. Nobody on the Princess Cecile had noticed the smell before filling the container with water. They'd been in a hurry, of course.
Daniel said mildly. the midshipman said. Daniel said, As Daniel spoke, he pushed his way along the edge of the ravine, to the right of the collapsed bank. For the first twenty feet it was merely a matter of muscling through twigs as dry as old bones. Just this side of the sandstone inclusion he'd seen as he entered the ravine grew a plant the size and shape of a wicker hassock. Its body consisted of strands curving up from the base to a central stem. A few had released their upper attachment and lay like whips on the ground.
said Daniel. The one filled with contaminated water would be even better, but Daniel didn't blame Sun for letting out his anger. Besides, the thing was done.
Dasi tossed an empty plastic container to Hogg, who passed it in turn to Daniel. Daniel said.
He squatted, judged the distance, and threw himself flat as he lobbed the jerrican. It landed in the center of the plant. There was a whap-pap-pap as all the remaining strands released simultaneously. The seeds at the ends of each, glass-hard and the size of marbles, flew forty feet in all directions. The can spun into the air, then dropped onto the ruins of the plant.
Daniel said; preening himself on his observation, but doing it in so quiet a voice that not even Hogg could have heard him. He stepped past the plant to the rock plug.
Daniel said to his servant. Hogg muttered. Over his shoulder he called, Jeshonyk, a power room technician, brought the shovels. He stepped gingerly over the discharged bush, carefully avoiding putting his foot on any of the now-flaccid strands. Daniel had seen Jeshonyk tighten a fitting under the Tokamak, working in the full knowledge that a slip wouldn't leave his mates so much as a pinch of ash to bury. He'd been wholly unconcerned by that risk, but the notion of a plant that shot bullets bothered him. It's all a matter of what you're used to. . . .&nbsp;
Hogg handed Jeshonyk the impeller in exchange for shovels, then got to work with Daniel from opposite sides of the plug. Daniel could've passed the job off to one of the crewmen, but he probably had more experience with shovels than any of them did. It brought back memories of his boyhood, digging out Black-Scaled Rooters with Hogg.
You could lose your foot at the ankle from a rooter's teeth if you weren't quick. Daniel remembered that too.
He hit rock; he moved out a hand's breadth and put the blade in again, using all the strength of his upper body. This time it sank halfway and he stamped it fully in with the heel of his right boot.
He exchanged glances with Hogg, then both levered their shovels to the right and left in unison. A slab of dense clay fell away, baring a foot of the plug. It tapered to both ends and was wedged with smaller stones from within the burrow.
Daniel said, thrusting the shovel into the ground beside him where it would be out of the way. Hogg's lips pursed in consideration. he said. Daniel took the plug in both hands and wriggled it. The block weighed well over a hundred pounds, but nothing beyond its mass bound it into place from this side now that they'd dug the bank away.
Daniel drew back, gasping with controlled effort. Rotating his body he half lifted, half flung the plug into the brush behind him. As smoothly as if the same cam controlled him and his master, Hogg thrust the muzzle of the impeller into the hole&#151;not to shoot, at least not instantly, but to physically prevent anything that tried to leap out.
Nothing did. The opening was lined with rock slabs. They weren't mortared into place, but they certainly weren't a natural occurrence. Distinct patches of light showed in the interior.
said Sentino. She'd drawn her knife; with her left hand she unlatched her equipment belt and let it curl to the ground beside her. Daniel frowned. he said. He locked his visor down so that he could look into the burrow under light enhancement. He patted his belly deliberately.
said the gunner's mate. He handed Daniel the weapon.
When Daniel used that tone, nobody argued&#151;even if they fancied their own marksmanship beyond what they thought their captain was up to. Daniel had more real out-in-the-woods experience than any of the spacers, and he trusted himself not to shoot more than he did Sun or even Hogg.
He grinned at Sentino. he said. Sentino sneered. She squirmed into the opening with as little difficulty as the creature from the night before had shown when it escaped. In truth, there wasn't much difference in weight, and the spacer had more of hers in her legs and arms.
Her boots disappeared down the tunnel. Barnes and Dasi lunged into their work, chopping the shovel blades into the bank and ripping away the dirt. They were used to working together. Even though this task wasn't a familiar one, they didn't get in each other's way.
One slab sagged, then the whole construct collapsed on itself. Barnes thrust his shovel in high, then lowered it and dragged out several feet of rock and dirt with the back edge.
Hogg looked at Daniel and raised an eyebrow in approval. They'd both dug enough holes to appreciate how much strength Barnes's action had required. Dasi leaned forward and cleaned much of the remainder.
Sentino called over the intercom. Sun said, stripping off his belt and flexing his shoulders. He grinned apologetically at Daniel. Anger and a direct need for him had brought the gunner's mate back from a funk that seemed even more unreal now that it was past. Sun simply wasn't a man you could imagine that happening to.
said Daniel. He moved aside. Barnes and Dasi stepped back together with their shovel heads locked, making a final sweep of the debris.
Sun put his knife in his teeth and took the shovel from Barnes. He thrust it ahead of him as he followed Sentino.
Daniel said, nodding to the man. Anything Barnes's shoulders cleared would probably pass Hogg's belly, so it was a good test. Nobody protested at the order of entry, not that a protest was going to change anything. There was a risk to splitting his small force, but Daniel was unwilling to let one or two of his personnel scout a burrow system that held scores or possibly hundreds of the creatures who'd dug it. A team of eight with an impeller could support itself.
Daniel continued. Barnes had grunted his way into the tunnel and Miquelon was ready to follow; she held her equipment belt ahead of her rather than dropping it on the ground as the others had. He'd meant to say not Vesey and Matahurd stood in sight at the corner of a bush whose tasseled crown fluttered occasionally like a stand of ultramarine flags. The midshipman trotted forward to take the weapon and shovel, speaking briskly. Daniel couldn't hear the words, so she was addressing the members of her section alone over the intercom.
Daniel nodded mentally, though his head didn't really move. She had the makings of a good officer.
Daniel said as he gave Vesey the impeller. Hogg, wheezing like a rooting sow, thrust himself into the burrow. Daniel waited a comfortable five seconds and followed. It was tight, but never so constricting that he wondered if he was going to be caught. At the far end of a tunnel no longer than the six feet Sentino had estimated was&#151;
Well, was a paradise of pastel light and plants which swooped toward the twenty-foot ceiling like constructions of cast plastic. The spacers wandered among them in amazement. The air was noticeably more humid than that in the ravine outside.
Daniel said. Besides humidity, the air was perfumed. Gnatlike insects drifted through the mist of light, and&#151;
Daniel called, lifting his visor out of the way. He didn't need its enhancement nor protection from windblown grit. Jeshonyk said, pointing his arm as Daniel joined him under one of the bright patches. It was a good eight feet in diameter, made of quartz wedged into place with other bits of stone. The contruction was similar to that of the entranceway lining.
Dasi said, prodding one of the gorgeous plants with the point of his knife. Daniel squinted. There were at least . . . ten bright patches in the ceiling, with more merging into the distance beyond just as Dasi said. The separation between pairs was about thirty feet, making Daniel's estimate of possibly hundreds of creatures in the burrow now seem absurdly low. Besides this central aisle of plantings, narrow passages led off to either side.
Daniel considered the pattern of light and shadow above him. The quartz blocks weren't uniformly translucent, and the faces refracted light so that the composite lens looked as though a giant spiderweb lay across it. Even so, Daniel could see that the western edge was brighter than the east.
Daniel said. a spacer asked. Nobody replied, perhaps because the answer was too obvious when you thought about it.
Sun dug the shovel into the cavern wall, then withdrew it with a puzzled expression. Only a trickle of dirt followed the blade. he said. Daniel walked over to the petty officer, rounding a plant set into the floor in a stone-lined tub. All the cavern's vegetation was soft-bodied though it was more the size of trees than ordinary plants. The genera were unfamiliar to Daniel; certainly they weren't native to Sexburga's arid surface today.
offered Dasi, holding up his left index finger. On it gleamed a drop of clear sap from the wound he'd pricked in the plant he was examining. Hogg muttered. He held the impeller across his chest, ready to spin in any direction and throw the weapon to his shoulder. He was perfectly poised, but he was also as uncomfortable as Daniel had ever seen him.
Daniel touched the wall with his bare hand. As Sun had said, there was a clear, slightly resilient, coating over the gritty clay. It felt warm to the touch.
Daniel said, but his mind was more on the wonder of this place than it was on Hogg's question or the more general business of reaching the beacon to summon help. They wouldn't delay here&#151;they had their duty, after all&#151;but by heaven! what a report Commodore Pettin and the civilized universe would get. Sentino cried. She darted into the passage.
Daniel heard a spreek! that might have been Sentino but probably wasn't. He stabbed his knife into the sidewall to free his hands and ducked to follow the crewman down the passage. He wasn't sure even Sentino would clear the low ceiling if she stood upright.
He supposed she was still carrying her knife in her hand. She almost had to be, since she'd left the sheath with the rest of her belt gear. Grabbing a creature with teeth like the one last night bare-handed was dangerous, but Daniel would just as soon Sentino not stab&#151;
she called. There was a tearing-paper sound. Sentino staggered back into Daniel's arms; the knife slipped from her flaccid right hand. Dropping the remains of a fist-sized puffball on the passage floor, the creature she'd grabbed with her left squirmed away. It began to dig furiously in the sidewall with spadelike forepaws.
There was a dry smell in the air, dizzying though not unpleasant. Daniel slapped his visor down with his left hand and felt the filters clamp his nostrils.
The hairless creature looked sideways at him through the spraying dirt and gave a wail of despair. Daniel grabbed Sentino under the arms and backed, pulling her with him. She was a dead weight, but he could feel her heart beating strongly through her coveralls.
Something came around the bend just beyond where the creature was digging into the sidewall. It completely filled the passage, brushing cascades of soil down where its shoulders rubbed. Daniel couldn't get a good look at it since his own body blocked most of the light coming from the main gallery, but he could tell that it was black and bigger than he was.
The smaller creature went and vanished, apparently dropping into an adjacent passage. The newcomer paused, its eyes focused on Daniel and Sentino. Its four canines projected forward to crisscross like paired ice-tongs, perfect tools to take living prey. It hunched like a cat preparing to spring.
Daniel stepped over his crewman's body. he shouted. The predator flowed toward him like a snake striking. It pushed off with its spatulate forepaws but folded them back against its sides in the course of the motion.
Daniel caught it by the neck, shoulder-broad and covered with a ruff of bristles. The fangs clashed just in front of his visor. The impact was like that of a charging bull. Daniel had braced himself, but it threw him back anyway.
His right boot tramped something soft&#151;Sentino's outflung hand, but he lifted his foot and felt her snatched back with no more ceremony than a case of rations would get. That was fine: dinner was just what she'd be if they didn't get her back quickly.
Daniel couldn't hold the creature, didn't want to hold it, but if he didn't continue fighting it would push him over backward. Then the only question was whether it'd tear his throat out or start by devouring his belly.
he wheezed. His toes skidded slowly backward down the passage. He felt his left knee start to buckle. He twisted that foot sideways in a desperate attempt to get more traction.
The jaws closed again. This time the tip of one lower fang hit Daniel's visor and slammed his helmet against the passage roof. Despite the shock-absorbant liner, Daniel's consciousness shattered into white light. As he felt himself going over, he kicked out blindly with both feet.
The predator made its first sound, a whuff of surprise as Daniel's bootheels hammered its muzzle. It flowed forward again.
Hogg, leaning over his master, socketed the impeller in the predator's right eye and squeezed the trigger. The whack! of the weapon's circuitry merged with the CRASH! of dense bone disintegrating at the impact of the hypersonic pellet.
The creature lurched into the central gallery and sprawled, its paddlelike hind legs covering Daniel's torso. Its body struck Hogg and sent him spinning away, though he still kept hold of the impeller. Sun drove the shovel into the creature's neck; it skidded off, gouging the floor and narrowly missing Daniel's hand. Other spacers were hacking with their knives.
Daniel shouted. He clutched his hands in to his chest, reminded by the comment that might very well be him. The creature's head and feet twisted upward in a convulsion; Daniel used the respite to snatch his body clear of a weight that he hadn't been able to shift with his own strength.
He got shakily to his feet. Barnes put an arm around him and lifted him several steps back to where the creature's spastic movements couldn't knock him down again. Its limbs were modified for digging, but claws that cut through rocky clay would be just as destructive if they met human bone and muscle.
The creature flopped over on its spine and finished dying. Hogg's pellet had lifted the back off its skull, but the face wasn't seriously damaged save that one eyesocket was empty.
It weighed half a ton. It was as ugly as anything Daniel had ever seen. The foul breath that had blown from its mouth as it attacked now hung over the body like a miasma.
Apart from the crossed fangs, however, the face was undeniably human.
* * *
The Princess Cecile's utility aircar was little more than a frame linking a quartet of fan nacelles to the open-topped cabin where Adele, Tovera, and two spacers sat on benches of metal webbing. Adele shifted. The seats weren't as uncomfortable as they looked, but they looked very uncomfortable.
Tavastierna landed with only a moderate bang and bounce. That was a creditable performance given the car's heavy load, but Adele scowled anyway. She knew it wasn't fair to expect professional competence from a rigger who hadn't driven an aircar in months, but didn't have much to do with the present situation. The operation had very little margin for error.
she said, shouting to be heard over the whine of the fans spinning at zero angle of attack. Tavastierna looked surprised since their helmet intercoms would easily damp that level of external noise, but he obeyed without question.
Adele said as the blades wound down octave by octave. And our own, come to think of it, though that isn't the first priority for me at the moment, she added internally.
Tavastierna had landed behind a ridge whose front side was a little over a thousand yards from the knoll on which the Captal da Lund had built his fortress. Even Adele could have climbed the slope on this side; Dorst and Tavastierna wouldn't raise a sweat. The weight of the guns the men carried&#151;Dorst a stocked impeller, Tavastierna a submachine gun for the team's own protection&#151;wasn't a significant factor either.
Adele said. the midshipman agreed. When Adele checked the crew list for a sniper, she'd learned to her surprise that Dorst had been on the Academy marksmanship team and had won trophies in long-range competition. He'd assured her that his training involved hostage simulations rather than merely bull's-eye targets. He'd never done it for real&#151;killed&#151;but Adele well knew the effectiveness of training like what Dorst described.
A six-wheeled delivery van was trundling down the road from Spires; it would reach them in a few minutes. Adele and Tovera would join the spacers in the cargo box during the time the vehicle was out of sight of the Captal's residence, unless she decided to leave this job to Tovera after all.
Adele's servant looked at her and smiled. Tovera said. Dorst said stolidly.
Adele said. She tried to smile. It doubtless looked forced, but her natural expression at times like these was something that only a sociopath like Tovera could find humor in. The spacers nodded and started up the slope at an amazingly fast pace. They moved like a rigger and a healthy young athlete, not a librarian with a tendency to trip over her own feet, of course.
It was odd what you remembered. The most vivid recollection Adele had of the duel she'd fought when she was sixteen wasn't the face of the boy when her bullet hit: it was instead the pink mist in the air behind him, a mush of blood and fresh brains. The simulators she'd used for hours in her parents' townhouse hadn't prepared her for that.
The van's suspension squealed and rattled as it approached. They&#151;the Republic of Cinnabar, paying with funds which Mistress Sand had put at Adele's disposal&#151;were renting the vehicle for a sum not much short of what it had cost new. Just in case, though, the vehicle's Sexburgan owner and its regular driver were aboard the Princess Cecile with all they wanted to drink. Half a dozen spacers were sitting with them to make sure that they didn't decide to leave and maybe call the Captal.
Tovera shifted her body, working muscle groups with a minimum of movement. She was perfectly cool, but after all she had no more emotion than the submachine gun in her hands. She looked at Adele and said, Adele agreed coldly. Why should it bother her that Tovera considered her mistress and herself merely a pair of killers at this moment? It was true, after all.
Unlike Adele, Tovera had no conscience. But that wouldn't make any difference. It never had before.
The van pulled up beside the aircar. Koop was driving, wearing a Sexburgan caftan and a soft cap. The rest of the team were in RCN utilities, comfortable and unobtrusively colored. If this event went wrong, there was no chance of hiding who was responsible for it, no matter what they wore.
Well, Adele didn't intend that it go wrong.
Woetjans lifted the roller gate and jerked Adele into the cargo box. Bemish offered Tovera a hand, but she'd already hopped aboard with her usual economy. Tovera didn't look graceful, but she moved without error. It was rather like watching a door open and close. The motion was without art, but it was always the same and always flawless.
Woetjans shouted, and the van accelerated from its rolling stop. There were five spacers in the back; Koop drove with a submachine gun under a towel on the seat beside him. More personnel would have crowded the vehicle and wouldn't, in the opinion of Woetjans and Mon, have contributed to the success of the operation. There were twenty-one people in the Captal's compound; the number hadn't changed since Dorotige had returned from South Land. They were on alert, but that was different from really being alert. The van delivered food to the compound on a regular schedule. The guards would search the vehicle, but they wouldn't be surprised to see it arriving.
Adele smiled faintly. The surprise would come shortly after that arrival.
Adele looked at the faces around her, lighted through the opera window in one of the door's upper slats. she asked, more because the spacers seemed to expect something from her than out of real concern for the answer. said Liebig, hugging his submachine gun to his chest. The others' guttural sounds of approval blended well with the groans of the van's suspension.
Adele put her visor down momentarily to check the distance to the Captal's front gate. She still wasn't comfortable with getting information from the helmet display; it made her resentful and more than a little angry not to be able to be able to use her personal data unit in normal fashion.
Normally she wouldn't be bouncing around in the back of a delivery van. Besides, the helmet display worked perfectly well as it read down the distance in yards: 831, 830, 829&#151;a lurch as the vehicle rounded a switchback and its transmission shifted to a lower gear&#151;827 . . .
Moronick began to sing under his breath: His thumb covered and uncovered the receiver switch that controlled his impeller's power. It was in the off, safe, position. He didn't turn it on, but the touch of the plastic fascinated him.
Adele was the only one of those present who didn't carry a shoulder weapon, either a submachine gun or a semiautomatic impeller throwing heavy slugs. There was a small pistol in her left side pocket. It was the weapon she knew, the weapon she pointed as if her eye and not her hand controlled it.
It would do. It had done many times in the past.
The van slowed gradually, then slewed shrieking to the right as a brake grabbed. 14, 13, 11 . . . Koop corrected with his steering wheel and brought them to a juddering halt.
Adele could hear the wind now, blowing the last of the grit kicked up by the truck's wheels against the metal body. an unfamiliar voice called.
Koop said. The cab door opened, then slammed. Adele blinked. Her impression of Koop was that he was rather more dense than the run of spacers. She'd told him to say, if asked. Koop's embellishment was wholly convincing, even though she knew it was nonsense.
the gateman said, his voice moving along the side of the van as boots crunched on the road metal. Everyone in the cargo compartment squatted. Woetjans handed her impeller to Bemish and drew an arm's-length piece of high-pressure tubing from beneath her belt.
the gateman continued. The door rattled at Koop's touch, then shot upward as fast as Liebig and Gansevoort could raise it from the inside.
The gateman was a lanky fellow whose ginger whiskers tried to cover serious acne scars. Woetjans grabbed his throat with her left hand.
WHACK! sounded from the top of the stone guard tower.
Woetjans rang the tubing off the gateman's skull, knocking off his mauve beret and putting a welt across his forehead. He went limp in her grip. Adele grabbed the keypad chained to his belt and punched in 5154, the code that raised the gate today. She could have entered the compound's security system through its communications link, but this was faster and simpler.
The body of the guard who'd watched from the tower's walkway fell flat on the ground beside the vehicle. There was a hole precisely between her staring eyes; apart from that she looked perfectly normal. From the amount of matter oozing through the fan of her hair, the slug had removed the back of her skull like the top of a soft-boiled egg.
The gate's two leaves cammed open; the row of spikes beyond began to sink into concrete sheaths. Koop scrambled back into the cab, pausing to snatch up the hat he'd lost in the flurry of activity.
The door at the foot of the guard tower was open. Adele and Gansevoort jumped out of the cargo compartment as Woetjans slung the unconscious gateman behind her rather than leave him on the ground. The sprawled corpse couldn't be seen through the open gate.
Adele said, but it was only her adrenaline-speeded senses that made it seem that Koop was delaying. The van jerked into motion, making those in the cargo compartment sway forward and back. Under cover of the vehicle, Adele and the spacer with her darted into the tower.
The van's back door was still open. Woetjans had retrieved her impeller from Liebig. The bosun's face had a detached expression, as though she were deciding who to assign to a mildly onerous duty.
Stairs led up from the anteroom of the guard tower. Through the other door was an office with a couch and refrigerator besides the control station. Adele sat at the control station while Gansevoort took the stairs two at a time, heading for the automatic impeller on top of the tower. He was Sun's striker, working toward a rating of gunner's mate.
The display was swirling pearly light. Adele brought up the main screen. A dozen keystrokes took her through the interlocks to first enter the security system, then to take complete control of all the compound's electronics. She displayed the courtyard imagery in a corner so that as she worked she could see the van driving past the barracks to the separated power room.
The power room door stood open, so she didn't have to bother unlocking it. Woetjans had a crate of explosives in the van against the possibility that the door would be closed with a manual bolt, but Adele was glad they could avoid noise for the moment.
Her control station had a touchplate. Adele's finger's danced across it, moving with precision if not what she would call verve. First she shut down communications to the other two guard towers, then switched their power off as well. The automatic impellers could still be fired, but without power traverse the guards would have to horse the weapons around manually to aim toward the courtyard. That would take minutes that they most certainly would not be allowed.
The van stopped in front of the power room. Woetjans led the four spacers with her into the squat building. The van, with Tovera now in the cab with Koop, made a U-turn and drove toward the Captal's residence.
Woetjans looked out of the power room and waved her free hand. Adele called over the intercom.
Gansevoort answered, so loudly that his voice echoed down the stairwell. The building vibrated as his impeller turned inward.
Adele keyed the fire alarms for the barracks and the residence building. An electronic wail filled the compound.
Nothing happened for a moment. Adele disconnected the power to both buildings. A moment later a servant wearing puffed red-and-yellow garments ran from the residence and three half-dressed guards from the barracks. They looked around in a mixture of anger and confusion.
Adele boomed over the public-address system. She turned off the siren. Woetjans and three of her team walked toward the barracks, their weapons aimed. The house servant turned. His arms flailed and he sprawled across the threshold at the feet of two more liveried servants.
Tovera got out of the van, pointing her submachine gun one-handed in what might have looked a negligent fashion to anyone who hadn't just seen her shoot. She beckoned the two surviving servants toward her with her free hand. One remained transfixed; the other knelt, clasped his hands, and lowered his head in prayer.
Adele said. Her amplified voice rumbled through the open doorways, cold and hectoring. The guards who were already in the open didn't try to run in the face of the spacers' guns, but no more came from the barracks.
Adele's brain warned her of movement. Instinct slid the pistol from her pocket, but the threat showed on her panoramic display rather than in the room with her.
she shouted. The tower guard braced himself on the catwalk rail, holding his pistol in both hands, and fired across the courtyard. Dust flew from the facade of the residence.
Tovera turned like mercury flowing. Even before she could fire, the top of the northeast tower erupted into dust, chunks of stone, and streaks of vivid color where osmium slugs struck the turret's metal fittings. Adele's control station vibrated with the violence of Gansevoort's long burst above her.
Gansevoort stopped firing. Woetjans' team and the guards in front of the barracks had thrown themselves on the ground. Bits continued to drop off the crumbled tower: the slugs had chewed away the west face of the railing and turret. The wind drifted dust from the compound like torn russet gauze. The only visible portion of the guard was his right arm lying among the debris in the courtyard, severed at the elbow by fifty grains of osmium moving at Mach 8.
Adele said, Another man came from the barracks, doubled over as if he were walking into a storm. Liebig taped his arms behind him. Two more guards crept out, their hands high. A woman came from the south tower, stumbling in her haste.
Woetjans cupped her hands and shouted in the direction of the gate. Adele grimaced and switched the helmet intercoms live again. she said. Woetjans voice said in synchrony with her lips on the other side of the courtyard. Adele said, rising to her feet. She'd never get used to RCN communications protocols. Of course, communications had never interested her very much. Knowledge for its own sake had been her focus.
She was smiling as she walked from the gate tower toward the residence building. A great deal had changed since she met Lt. Daniel Leary.
For the most part the spacers were exhilarated from the operation's present success. Bemish was babbling that by God we're showing these wogs how it's done, but Adele didn't let her distaste for the vulgar chauvinism touch the surface of her mind.
Koop alone looked reserved. That was perhaps his normal reaction to things going well, but equally it might have had something to do with the bloodstains on his uniform where he'd knelt while securing the two living servants.
Tovera switched the ammunition tube under her weapon's barrel for a fully loaded one from the pouch on her left side. Her eyes darted in all directions, and her smile was as thin and cold as a streak of hoarfrost.
Adele said. She shook her head at the silliness of anyone thinking they could hide in a building with a surveillance system as complete as the Captal's. Even his private suite was covered, though he probably believed he'd switched the cameras off when he realized that the compound was under attack.
Adele continued. Woetjans said. The maintenance tech nodded. He was leaning against the doorjamb so that it supported some of the weight of his pack.
Liebig asked. He'd looked hungrily at the Captal's big aircar when he trotted past it beside the bosun. Tovera said. Like Adele herself, she was using imagery from the compound's internal system to view their opponents.
The tip of Tovera's tongue touched her lips. Adele said. She nodded to the open door. In Adele's normal state of mind she would have been irritated by Tovera's enthusiasm for killing. At present&#151;
She glanced down at the cratered back of the servant who'd tried to run. Blood was congealing in the holes where velocity had disintegrated the ten-grain pellets like tiny bombs when they struck.
If there is a God, may She forbid that I ever find this sort of business normal.&nbsp;
Woetjans left a man in the doorway and another in the foyer, then led the way up the staircase. Adele had locked the kitchen door and shut off the elevator, so there was no need of a guard down here. They wouldn't need another man upstairs either, though, so she didn't comment on the bosun's arrangements.
An ornate metal door stood in the center of the second floor's semicircular anteroom. It was finished to look like bronze, but Adele knew from the contractor's specifications that it was actually tungsten over a core of lime.
Adele said as they faced the door. She'd set the compound's intercom to be cued by her helmet. There was no response. Tovera said.
Adele grimaced. It was so unnecessary. she said.
Tovera said, holding out her submachine gun. The bosun looked startled but handed over the stocked impeller when Adele nodded. Tovera, aiming by the image projected on her visor, pointed the weapon at the wall to the right of the armored door.
The whack! of the shot was startlingly loud in the enclosed space. The slug's driving band flashed as it ionized; it was a ghostly yellow glow remained in the air for several seconds. The wall was of thick structural plastic, intended to deaden sound but not to stop rounds from an impeller. Chips flew into the anteroom and a cavity the size of a soup dish spalled off the inside.
The slug continued straight and true. The waiting guard leaped up, rolled over a table, and fell prone across the hand-knotted carpet. His blood splashed a broad pattern around the hole the slug took through the wall of the Captal's bedroom.
Tovera gave the impeller back to Woetjans. she said.
Adele squatted and took out her personal data unit; the helmet's inputs weren't sufficient for what she needed now. At a nod from the bosun, Jiangsi shrugged off his pack and began lifting out blocks of explosive with the blasting caps already in preformed sockets.
said Adele, concentrating on her display. Jiangsi offered. Adele repeated.
She turned on the vision panel above the Captal's huge circular bed and routed to it the output of the security camera in the main room of suite; she focused the image closely on what was left of the guard's head. The slug must have been tumbling slightly when it came through the wall.
Adele said through the intercom. Woetjans muttered. Her big scarred hand patted the length of tubing in her belt. She'd wrapped tape around one end for a better grip.
Adele continued. The man cowering in the bedroom suddenly snatched open his door. he cried. Adele rose to her feet and put her data unit back in its pocket. She lifted her visor; she didn't need to watch further. The spacers tensed, but Tovera merely shook her head in disappointment.
The bar scraped on the other side of the door. When Woetjans heard it click free of the staples, she kicked the panel open with the heel of her boot. It bloodied the Captal's nose as it knocked him down.
Adele had never seen the exiled dictator in the flesh. He would have looked distinguished under most circumstances, but blubbering so that tears streaked the blood on his cheeks was not his best moment. Woetjans and Jiangsi thrust their guns in his face.
the Captal cried. It was funny in its way. Adele said. Tovera said. They were playing a game, she and her mistress, but every word of it was true. She shrugged. Adele was unable to keep to keep from sneering when she looked down at the sniveling exile, but perhaps that was the right expression for the purpose anyway. she said evenly, the Captal said. He'd pulled his knees up to his chest and his fingers covered his face, pressing to either side of his nose. Was it broken, or was it simply fear that had so unmanned him? Woetjans tapped the Captal's left wrist with her impeller muzzle. The heat shield was still hot from the recently fired slug; the prisoner jerked his hand down with a cry of terror.
Woetjans said. the Captal cried. Adele frowned. she asked the bosun.
Woetjans shrugged. she said. She switched to intercom. Her lips continued to move, but the helmet's dampers smothered the words. A moment later she nodded and said, the Captal said. The Captal had brought his right hand to his face again but seemed generally to have relaxed. A good sign, Adele supposed. The heat shield hadn't even raised a blister. From the way he'd jumped, one might have thought his hand was being singed off.
Woetjans said. Adele said. The Captal slowly lowered his hands and let his legs extend slightly. he said, his voice husky with fear.
Adele said. Woetjans grinned, though she still had a worried expression. she said. Jiangsi rolled the Captal over on his belly and taped his wrists. Woetjans looked sourly at the captive, then said to Adele, Adele said. the bosun said.
Adele nodded. she said. said Woetjans. She bent and lifted the Captal by his bound wrists. He screamed until he got his feet under him to take the weight from his arms. She slung the Captal toward the stairwell. she said, &nbsp;

CHAPTER NINETEEN
Jiangsi warned, looking out the side of the servants' compartment.
Adele said, but her mind was on entering the names and descriptions of the members of the conspiracy as the Captal Da Lund remembered them. He and Dorotige were curled on the compartment floor, their limbs taped. The Captal babbled while his guard chief remained as silent as a corpse except to answer direct questions.
Adele was making an audio recording of the information, but by entering key words manually on her personal data unit she put it in a far more accessible place: her current memory. She didn't know what she might need in the future, so she learned as much as she could.
Liebig rotated the aircar 180 degrees on its axis. They'd flown so smoothly that Adele had forgotten that she was in a vehicle; now she tilted forward out of the jump seat. Only Jiangsi's snatching arm kept her from toppling onto the prisoners.
Jiangsi said politely. As he spoke, he unlocked and lifted the aircar's rear door. Liebig had put down on the quay just a few feet short of the Princess Cecile's gangplank.
He looked down at the prisoners with an expression of contempt. More to the point, Woetjans was already outside the compartment with her arm crooked to keep Adele from tripping as she got out. Adele put her data unit away and grabbed the bosun's arm; she wasn't one to injure herself when she might be needed through a foolish overestimate of her abilities.
Adele started for the gangplank. Woetjans held her. the bosun said; which was perfectly obvious, once Adele looked at her surroundings instead of focusing on her plans for the immediate future.
Tovera and Woetjans' team stood beside the aircar, their weapons less incongruous now than they would have seemed the day they landed. The Princess Cecile's dorsal turret was not only raised but live: the plasma cannon slowly traversed the corniche above the harbor. Only two ventilation hatches were open. From them projected automatic impellers on mounts which Taley and her mate had welded from tube stock. The four guards at the entrance hatch were alert and completely sober.
Mon crossed the gangplank with the swift grace of a rigger. He wore his utilities and an equipment belt including a holstered pistol, something Adele had never seen an officer on shipboard do.
he said. Drunk, Mon became angrily morose, but he was always intense when sober. At the moment he looked as though you could etch glass with the angles of his face.
Adele said, detailing the information in as bald and precise a manner as she could. She cleared her throat. she said, Mon said. Though his voice was emotionless, his scowl could have meant anything. The late-afternoon sky above the line of cliffs flashed amber, then faded to the pale grayish white of moments before. Adele felt the shockwave through her bootsoles. The water in the harbor rose in tight conical waves. All around the harbor, spacers looked up.
The airborne blast was measurable seconds later. It sounded more like a huge steam leak than an explosion.
said Palaccios, the engineer's mate who'd wedged open the compound's power room before running to the aircar. He and Jiangsi clasped arms and pounded one another on the back.
Adele said.
Mon said, pointing a finger skyward. He sounded straightforward rather than sardonic. The flare had dissipated, but the western sky continued to sparkle as ions snatched free electrons and reverted to their normal state.
Jiangsi said, jerking his thumb toward the servants' compartment where the Captal lay bound. Mon asked, interested but not concerned.
Woetjans said. Mon grinned broadly, the first time Adele had seen him wear a positive expression. he said. Adele said. If she'd been able to continue, she would&#151;she might&#151;have blurted the name of Mistress Sand.
Lt. Mon said, his face suddenly stark. It was odd to find out how much she had absorbed by being in the RCN. Adele actually saluted before she turned to choose the three spacers who'd accompany her, Tovera, and the prisoners to South Land.
* * *
Daniel checked the sun and determined that it was five minutes short of local noon. His helmet would have given him the time correct to milliseconds, but for this purpose he preferred to use his eyes as he would have done in the forests of Bantry. He wouldn't always be wearing a helmet.
sang the detachment behind him, Sun the loudest of all. He seemed to be all right&#151; being the operative word. The gunner's mate had done everything with enthusiasm since the spacers returned to the surface with full water cans and fruit from the cavern stuffed into the pockets of their utilities. He was an active man who deserved his rating, but his present demeanor smacked of a boy whistling in the dark.
That was perfectly all right with Daniel. All that mattered was that Sun had found a way to overcome his funk.
Vesey came up on Daniel's left side, opposite Hogg. They weren't trying to keep a formal order of march, though everyone knew to stay within a few paces of the next spacer ahead.
Daniel smiled at the midshipman and said, Vesey said. She meant her tone to be professional, but her dry throat tripped her into a squeak in the middle of the short phrase. Hogg commented, casting his eye back on the spacers. Hogg spat. he added.
Vesey said. Daniel kept his expression blank as he considered both the question and what was behind the question. The Princess Cecile was too small to rate a chaplain, so the crew's religious health was part of the captain's duties. That was pretty clearly the hat Vesey wanted him to wear now.
Daniel said carefully. There was a ravine close by to the left. Daniel had intended to declare a break and lead the expedition into it&#151;and he would, but first he needed to deal with the midshipman's question in the privacy that the march provided.
Vesey said uncomfortably. Daniel said. Hair, skin, and a scrap of bone blown from the back of the creature's skull. The last contained marrow. The bushes growing to the lip of the nearby ravine made a brilliant contrast to everything around it. Though the small leaves were the dull red usual on Sexburga, they merely speckled the yellow and white striped bark of the trunks and branches. Daniel didn't recall anything so colorful from the natural-history database. The species might be new to science. Human science.
he said, Vesey said. She sighed with obvious relief. She stopped, flustered, then blurted onward, Daniel kept a straight face, suspecting that if he smiled it would delay the midshipman even more. Besides, he had more to say. Vesey's misunderstanding was comforting to her, but Daniel couldn't in good conscience leave her in it.
he said. Vesey raised her visor so that she could rub her eyes. she said. Which in the tone she used was equivalent to, Well, Vesey knew as surely as Daniel himself did that the RCN didn't train its officers to lie to their subordinates.
Daniel turned, his mouth open to order his people to fall out for a ten-minute break. said Jeshonyk over the intercom. Daniel did hear the distant mixture of high and low tones now, though he hadn't until Jeshonyk called it to his attention. Power room crewmen had an almost mystical ability to pick up mechanical noises&#151;and particularly variations in mechanical noises. When you were dealing with fusion bottles, quick diagnosis of strange sounds could be the difference between life and death for the whole ship.
Daniel bellowed, lifting his visor so that the helmet wouldn't muffle his voice. He deliberately didn't trip the intercom. The spacers scrambled over the edge of the ravine like children entering a swimming pool: in a variety of fashions, all of them clumsy. Hogg disappeared also, but without kicking up a sand grain or disturbing a leaf of the sheltered bushes. Hogg looked portly and seemed slow until he saw a need to move quickly.
Daniel continued. He faced the south and smiled for the oncoming vehicle which he couldn't see without magnifi&#151;no, he could after all, there was a glint in the sky. Daniel lowered his visor again and increased the magnification. He sounded like quite the sanctimonious prig, now that his mind had leisure to review what he'd just said. At the time it had seemed like what was called for, though; and maybe it was.
The oncoming vehicle was an aircar, not an armored personnel carrier. It was large enough to carry quite a number of soldiers, but marksmen as good as Hogg and Sun could shoot it into a colander if that were required. Daniel's people wouldn't start the firefight, though, and Daniel himself made an easy target as well.
He grinned naturally at a further thought. He'd just made the sort of speech that would look well in a book like Our Navy's Martyred Heroes; which he'd read when he was eight, and which he might very possibly have stolen the words from. Well, the RCN put more of a premium on propriety than originality.
Daniel's earphones announced in a crisp, familiar voice. It was like hearing his mother crooning when he woke screaming from an infant nightmare. There was a pause which presumably included Adele getting some politely worded suggestions from within the aircar. she said.
Daniel said. The aircar was descending as it neared, keeping an even keel instead of dropping its nose in a dive. The driver&#151;Liebig? Daniel doubled his magnification to 40x. Yes, Liebig. The driver was more able than Daniel had realized.
Daniel noticed who was with Liebig and Adele in the vehicle's cab. A slight frown wriggled his brows.
another voice said. Hogg stepped up beside Daniel, laughing like he hadn't done since one of Mistress Leary's city visitors had fallen into the Bantry cesspool. he said between gulps of laughter. said Daniel. &nbsp;

CHAPTER TWENTY
It was crowded with four on the cab's bench seat, but Woetjans had insisted in riding up front with Adele, Daniel and Liebig. The central driver's station was the problem: Adele was squeezed between Daniel and the right doorpanel, while Woetjans had the relative luxury of all the space to Liebig's left.
Woetjans didn't do things without a reason. Adele wouldn't have requested the bosun's presence, but her strength and experience had been a welcome addition when Mon ordered that she accompany Adele's party.
Daniel said. Woetjans said. Adele felt her lips tighten at the bosun intercepting a request meant for her. Daniel said. There was a touch of reserve in his tone, an echo of what Adele herself was feeling. Adele said. She'd already wiggled out her personal data unit and brought it live. Adele had linked the aircar's satellite radio to her RCN helmet, but she couldn't claim to be any more comfortable with the helmet than she was with the radio's own peculiar voice controller. She'd learned on the flight out from Spires that the aircar was as smooth as a library table, so she'd reprogrammed the unit in order to run it with her wands through the data unit.
She hadn't expected to be quite as cramped as she was at the moment, but the task was easy enough. She switched on the radio and brought up the RCN menu as she spoke.
Daniel said reflectively. He didn't sound depressed, but his voice wasn't as boyishly ebullient as usual. He grinned. he said, Woetjans said. Daniel leaned forward to look at the bosun past Liebig. Obviously the driver had been warned to expect what was happening now, because he had a false smile and his eyes fixed front.
Daniel prompted gently. Adele froze her display and watched the tableau from her corner.
Woetjans said. She did sound sorry. Though she faced Daniel, her eyes were focused a thousand miles away. Adele couldn't see Daniel's face from where she sat, but his silence itself was telling. Woetjans took a deep breath and continued in an anguished voice, Adele dipped her chin in a nod of understanding.
Woetjans tapped her length of tubing with a little finger. She'd brought it to encourage the Captal if that proved necessary. It wasn't. The prisoners hadn't even complained aloud at being marooned with the remnants of food Daniel's unit had brought to South Land.
said Daniel. He leaned back in his seat and grinned. he added. It was an honest question, so Adele paused a moment to form a complete and honest answer. she said. She grinned just enough to lift one corner of the knife blade line of her lips. she went on, Daniel laughed merrily. he said, He twisted to look through the window into the passenger compartment. Woetjans had brought a cask of Sexburgan beer for the rescued unit, saying that it wouldn't affect their ability to function when they reached the corvette. Adele wondered how Tovera was getting along with the festive spacers.
Daniel turned back with a satisfied expression. he said. she said, frowning. Daniel didn't mean to be insulting, but how would he react if she said, Woetjans said. Daniel said without expression. He tried to smile but gave it up as a bad job after a moment.
Adele checked the machine-made transcripts of the past four and a half hours of commo traffic between squadron command and the Princess Cecile; for her, written text provided a quicker way to assess material than sound bites were. Each message in turn proved low-level and routine: duty rosters, liberty records, the current supply manifest, and similar matters.
While she was scrolling through the data, the display threw up a red sidebar: the Princess Cecile was receiving a communication for the captain and slugged Squadron Six&#151;Commodore Pettin himself. Betts, the duty officer, had just passed the call on as directed.
Adele paused only a moment, then routed the message live through the speakers in both cab and passenger compartment.
Mon's voice said. Commodore Pettin replied. Adele wasn't good at identifying voices, but no one else in the squadron would have shown such disregard for naval propriety. Mon said, Daniel's left hand clenched, released, and then clenched again. His expression remained calmly attentive, his head cocked slightly to the side.
the commodore said, his tone suddenly cheerful. said Lt. Mon. Pettin said. He didn't sound angry, just amazed. The transmission ended in the hiss of an open line; Adele broke the contact. No one in the cab spoke for a moment.
Adele looked out the side window. The aircar was over land again; North Land, she supposed, but geography didn't greatly interest her. Most of the continent was as barren as its wholly uninhabited sister.
Daniel said quietly. He gave first Woetjans, then Adele a smile with something of steel in it. * * *
As the aircar dropped in tight spirals into the harbor, Daniel noted that the Princess Cecile was ready to lift off as soon as the gangplank came in. The turret would have to be lowered and two hatches were for the moment being used as gunports, but in an emergency all that could be taken care of while the corvette was bound for orbit.
Daniel nodded in approval. That was what he'd expected, of course, from Mon or any competent RCN officer, but it was still a pleasure and relief to see that his confidence had been justified.
They landed just short of the gangplank. A curtain of spray flashed up from the quay: wheeled traffic had worn the stone enough that it filled when vessels maneuvering in nearby slips sloshed the harbor's surface. Liebig cursed because he hadn't noticed the puddle in the twilight, but Daniel wouldn't have cared if he'd been standing in the middle of the splash. He couldn't be much more bedraggled than the past few days marching in the desert had left him.
Woetjans bellowed. The passenger compartment had double doors to ease the passage of the wealthy and corpulent. The spacers were neither, but they disembarked as hastily as they ran to action stations; the wide openings eased the process.
Woetjans was out before the car was fully at rest. Liebig followed an instant later after he'd shut off the power. Adele, on the other hand, was looking puzzled about what she should do next.
Rather than wait for her to open the door beside her, Daniel slid out past the steering yoke. he called as he trotted to the gangplank past the crewmen waiting tautly for their captain to lead them aboard.
Daniel felt thoroughly alive. The Princess Cecile had missed the squadron's liftoff, a difficult situation but not necessarily a career-ending one. He'd have to play his hand as well as ever an officer did to save himself, however.
said Mon's voice on the helmet earphones. Daniel went through the corvette's entryway at a brisk walk instead of the dead run that instinct urged him to. He didn't want to waste time, but in fact a few minutes here or there wouldn't make any difference. A hasty error would mean disaster&#151;and if he spooked his crew into such an error, it could be just as bad as his own blunder.
Daniel said as he banged up the righthand&#151;upward&#151;companionway, taking the steps two at a time. That was normal practice, and a rigger's reflex kept his left hand gliding over the railing the whole time to catch him if he slipped. The ship's machinery was live, a symphony of whirrs, whines, and the occasional flurry of clanking like a drum riff. Spacers waited at their action stations. The bow dorsal section of riggers, both watches, stood suited in the corridor. They flattened themselves against either bulkhead as Daniel passed, nodding with a stern smile.
He threw himself into his seat and rotated the command console to face his officers. A year ago Daniel would've radioed his plans ahead to the Princess Cecile, trusting RCN encryption to limit his message to its intended hearers if he even bothered to think about security. A few months of contact with Adele Mundy had showed him that an information specialist with a powerful computer at her command could read anything she got in electronic form.
There might be eavesdropping devices on the Princess Cecile's bridge&#151;and unlikely though that was, it was greater than the chance of there being another specialist of Adele's skill on Sexburga. Even so, Daniel had ceased to say anything over the air that he didn't want others to hear.
Mon and Pasternak&#151;with a long cut on his forearm, covered with a sprayed binder/antiseptic; the Chief Engineer didn't limit his duties to giving orders&#151;came down the corridor behind Daniel. The other warrant officers (including Taley, who wasn't a watchstander but was understandably curious about what was going on) were already on the bridge.
Daniel beamed. He had a great crew, a crew that other captains would give an arm for, and they'd every one of them volunteered to serve with Lt. Daniel Leary. By God! they had.
Daniel said, starting without preamble because he'd sound weak if he tried to articulate what he felt about the spacers he commanded, There was a general chorus of nods and murmurs. Woetjans slapped the bulkhead with her right hand and said, Adele alone sat with the neutral expression Daniel knew by now was what her face wore when she was trying not to sneer. He was quite sure that Adele would make her opinion known if Daniel said he intended to humiliate his commanding officer in the most public fashion possible; but she wouldn't go out of her way to insult fellow officers simply because their understanding differed from that of noblemen like herself and Daniel&#151;and senior officers like Commodore Pettin.
Daniel said. Faces grew shuttered; curious and, if not exactly concerned, then . . . Well, the crew of the Princess Cecile knew by now that if their captain said something would be difficult, they'd be sweating like pigs before they were through it.
Daniel said. He thought about the ways his plan could go wrong and smiled. He'd worn a similar expression the day he made an offer to three women; and they whispered together, giggled, and all three followed him down the corridor.
It could go wrong, but it wouldn't. Not with this crew to back him and recover from any miscalculations he made.
Several of the warrant officers looked blank; Mon scowled, his mouth working as though he were trying to swallow something ghastly, while Woetjans merely scratched herself and grinned. said Pasternak. Pasternak was by the nature of his duties a highly educated man, though Daniel suspected that&#151;besides Adele, of course&#151;in raw intelligence the bosun may have been the smartest of the warrant officers. Working with a fusion bottle required a great deal of rote learning, but independent thought was a quick route to disaster. Pasternak could be depended on to know the accepted response to most standard shipboard problems, and to deny that any other response was possible.
Daniel said, said Mon. Woetjans said, Daniel said, He'd swallowed the word before it reached his tongue. Daniel had no desire to insult Pettin, and to this group of officers and the RCN more generally, was indeed a word of insult.
There were general nods and grins. Daniel's officers assumed that because he said the task was possible, then they'd accomplish it under him. Which, after all, was the assumption their captain made as well.
Daniel said, Betts put his hands behind his neck and leaned back at his console. the missileer said, In the middle of the general approving chorus, Woetjans slammed her hand against the bulkhead again and bellowed, That too was pretty much how Daniel felt.
* * *
Adele sat cross-legged in a cabinful of opened luggage while the Princess Cecile bustled about her. Liftoff wouldn't be for hours, or so she'd surmised when she left Vesey to handle routine traffic at the signals console while she spent her own time more productively.
The door&#151;the hatch&#151;opened abruptly. Adele's head came around quickly and her left hand spilled chips on the deck beside her as it dipped toward her pocket.
Lt. Mon stepped through and paused, looking as surprised to find someone else in the room as Adele had been an instant earlier.
he said. He looked taut but not particularly alert. Adele said in surprise. The first lieutenant's uniform looked as though he'd slept in it; in truth, he probably hadn't slept at all.
Mon said, more patient now in his exhaustion than she'd seen him at times he was in better shape. He gestured toward the ship's medical computer, a full-body case which could diagnose and treat anybody who fit within its adaptive interior. Adele snapped, angry with herself. Yes, of course this was the room originally assigned her, which she'd completely forgotten; and of course the medical computer would be in regular use throughout the voyage. Why in heaven had she decided to review Vaughn's documents here rather than in her half of the captain's suite?
Looking thankful, Mon stripped off the jacket he'd already unsealed in the corridor. he said with a gray smile, gripping the pair of handholds and lifting himself feet-first into the cylinder with a grace that a professional acrobat might have envied. Adele said. On general principles she didn't care to go on with her business while Mon was in the room with her&#151;not that she'd turned up anything he shouldn't know. Besides, a break to chat with another human being was probably a good idea.
The mesh and microtubing of the Medic's interior settled over Mon's body like fluid moving along a pipette; he gave a great sigh as the equipment began to sample his body chemistry through his bare skin. He hadn't sunk his head in the tube, so he was able to watch and talk to Adele.
Mon asked. Bitterly he added, Adele said. She'd already read far enough in Vaughn's secret correspondence to be sure that the Navy Office had no record of him boarding the Princess Cecile. Vaughn's organization had bribed the real courier with enough money to make even a Mundy blink. You could rent a senator for a year for far less.
Lt. Mon gasped as though he'd been dropped into cold water. The Medic was cleansing his system of fatigue poisons and the breakdown products of the drugs he'd taken to stay alert over the past several days.
Mon's face relaxed the way a wax mask would on low heat. Color&#151;a healthier color than the previous sallow surface underlain by a metallic gray substrate&#151;returned to his cheeks.
he murmured, closing his eyes as his muscles luxuriated in chemical-induced relaxation. Adele said, Mon snorted. he said. Adele said. It might not be her place to say it, but it was as much her place&#151;because she was Daniel's personal friend&#151;as it was anybody's, and she was quite sure that it ought to be said. She'd started to call them but nothing would have been improper to achieve that end. There were things that would have turned Adele's stomach even to consider, but Daniel Leary would have returned to the Princess Cecile, no matter what the result cost his friends.
she continued as Mon writhed in the ecstasy of not being in pain, Mon started to laugh. For a moment Adele thought the Medic was tickling him; then she realized that the lining had withdrawn against the body of the cylinder, freeing the patient from its ministrations.
Mon crawled out of the Medic, his bare chest ruddy as if from a vigorous toweling. He started to speak but broke into chuckling for a further moment while he donned his utility jacket.
he said at last. With a bitterness at shocking variance with his amusement of moments before, Mon added, Adele said nothing. She looked up at Mon; her face calm, her gaze steady.
Mon patted the Medic's hood. he said affectionately. His face changed, though hardened wasn't quite the word to describe his new expression. He squatted so that he faced Adele with his eyes on the same level as hers. His elbows rested on his knees.
Mon said, Mon straightened with a grin and stepped to the door. he added over his shoulder, Adele watched the door close behind the lieutenant. It struck her that she'd just, for the first time, heard a religious philosophy with which she could agree.

CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE
As the Matrix rippled and pulsed beyond the tips of the Princess Cecile's antennas, it struck Daniel that Adele's saving grace wasn't her immense competence at the things she did well. No, she survived because she didn't claim competence where she had none.
And as the good Lord knew, Adele was even clumsier outside a ship than she was within the hull.
Daniel touched helmets with her. he said. Adele said; obviously a placeholder to indicate she'd heard him rather than a claim of comprehension. She seemed to be looking in the right direction, at any rate. He'd learned by now not to take that for granted.
They stood at the first joint of Dorsal 4, a position Daniel had chosen because D4's top and mid sails were furled on the present heading. If he were alone he'd be conning the Princess Cecile from an upper yard or even the mast truck, but with Adele . . . well, Daniel didn't know of any case where a safety line had parted except when a whole antenna was breaking up; but riggers generally didn't use safety lines, and those who did weren't regularly snubbed up by theirs as they went drifting off toward some distant universe.
Daniel said. He didn't point. All the crewmen in sight were watching him, and those on the peripheries were ready to relay his directions to their fellows stationed around the curve of the hull. Adele said. That was along the lines of saying that she breathed air, but Daniel tried to keep from frowning. Adele was trying to understand, albeit trying to understand something that was obvious to him. The cold, no-colored light surrounding the Princess Cecile was the human eye's response to the Casimir-Bohr Radiation that bathed the entire cosmos instead of being limited to individual bubble universes. The antennas and the sails of charged fabric they spread controlled the pressure of radiation on the vessel, driving it through and between universes whose physical constants differed from those of the sidereal universe.
Imbalances in Casimir radiation were the pragmatic reality of star travel. The light, pure as nothing in the human universe could be, was also beautiful beyond Daniel's ability to say.
Daniel said. He paused to make sure that she was taking hold of the mast&#151;which she didn't do until she realized that Daniel was waiting and watching until she obeyed what he'd meant for an order though he hadn't been willing to phrase it that way to a Mundy of Chatsworth. Perhaps he was being overly cautious, but he'd twice caught Adele's feet as they missed rungs on her climb up the antenna.
Sure that his friend was safe, Daniel strode out to the tip of the main yard. The magnetic strips in his bootsoles gave him a positive grip on the steel yard; rigger style, he duckwalked so that his insteps followed the curve of the yard and maximized the surface-to-surface contact. The added square inches greatly increased the grip of a spacer who might unexpectedly have a spar or a length of heavy tackle catch him between his shoulder blades. That extra could be the difference between life and a slow death in some universe not meant for Mankind.
Daniel could see four riggers; there might be more, all but an eyeslit concealed by the hull and rig. Beneath him, the half-furled mainsail quivered minusculely to the rhythm of his step. An expert eye&#151;his eye&#151;could see a reflection in the Matrix of even that infinitely small variation in the corvette's balance of energy.
Daniel signaled, bending his arms in riggers' code. The first symbol was the antenna for which the command was intended; the rest of the string, shorter or longer as need required, described the operations which were to be carried out on the antenna.
For the most part the riggers were on the hull to execute commands transmitted from the bridge by mechanical semaphore. The astrogation computer could process more data than any number of human beings in a lifetime: the captain set a course, and the computer translated that human desire into a path through the Matrix.
But the Matrix was as variable as a cloud-wracked sky, so a computer had only approximations of the reality through which the vessel sailed. No sensors but the human eye were available outside the hull, but the eye was a tool of great subtlety when used in the right fashion.
Daniel's arms moved; swiftly, precisely. He was modifying the set of six antennas, two of them on the ventral row which was completely hidden from him. The spacers watching him would relay his commands around and along the hull to those who were in position to carry them out.
Daniel couldn't have navigated the Princess Cecile to Strymon or even across the Cinnabar system by himself. He could refine the choices made by the astrogation computer, however; and right now, viewing aberrations in the smooth whirls of Casimir radiation . . . and all right, perhaps they weren't herringbones, exactly, but they were patterns that didn't belong in the natural sequence of the Matrix . . . viewing those markings, Daniel knew he'd found three ships travelling in close company.
Only naval forces did that. Well, naval forces and pirates coming to grips with their merchant prey. From the course and location, so close to what Daniel had plotted for the commodore, he was sure that he'd found the RCN squadron.
He grinned, seeing a faint reflection of himself in the faceplate of his rigging suit. Of course if it did turn out to be a pair of pirates homing in on an argosy, that would be all right as well. Much as Daniel wanted to join Commodore Pettin and mend fences on his own behalf and that of Lt. Mon, a chance to see off a pair of pirates on the way would be more than welcome.
Daniel finished his series of commands; the sails of Port and Starboard Two already beginning to ripple. Whistling a tune he'd learned as &#151;in the RCN it was sung as &#151;he returned to the mast with his arms crossed before his chest.
Adele stood like an awkward piece of equipment clamped to the mast, watching Daniel with a stony face. She'd obviously felt insulted by the degree of his concern that she'd do something fatally foolish.
Touching helmets with her, Daniel said, There was a risk the reprocessing latrine would explode when he used it too, but in neither case was it one that he'd bother to mention except as a way of soothing a friend's ruffled feathers.
Adele deliberately took one hand away from the mast and said, Daniel could feel the corvette start to rotate beneath him. The change was minute, a degree or two. The light of the cosmos flared in great banners from the Princess Cecile's mast trucks, highlighting the maneuver for those to whom the motion of the vessel was too subtle a cue.
Daniel explained, He grinned more broadly than he might have done if there'd been anybody to see his face. Since he was leaned sideways into contact with Adele's helmet, not even she could tell his expression. he added, Adele said. He could visualize her wry smile. Daniel cleared his throat. he said. said Adele. Daniel waited for her to decide how to raise the topic that had brought her onto the hull with him in the first place. Daniel said. It struck him that his words were a perfect echo of Adele's when he was trying to point out wakes in the Matrix to her. He'd heard what Adele said, but as for understanding what she meant, she could've been trying to communicate by eyeblinks. He simply didn't know how to go on. Did she expect him to aid Delos Vaughn openly? And if Daniel did, how in heaven's name was he going to explain his actions to Commodore Pettin, let alone the board of the court-martial which would surely be convoked on his return to Cinnabar?
Adele said, probably unaware of the relief her words gave Daniel. said Daniel. Daniel found himself smiling faintly. There was a real risk of Pettin reacting with explosive anger as soon as the Princess Cecile joined the squadron, but for all that Daniel didn't find himself particularly concerned. This voyage, even more than the record run from Cinnabar to Sexburga, was a piece of astrogation that Uncle Stacey and his friends would discuss for hours over mulled rum in the office of Bergen and Associates. Whatever happened to his career, Lt. Daniel Leary had a name that real spacers would always mention with honor.
Thinking of the coming interview with Commodore Pettin raised another question in Daniel's mind. he said. Adele said. Daniel said. said Adele. Daniel said. People couldn't have reached Sexburga under their own power back the forty, sixty, perhaps one hundred thousand years ago. It would've taken that long to modify humans into the creatures the expedition had found in the burrows under South Land.
Chickens hadn't reached Sexburga under their own power either; but there were chickens there now.
Daniel asked.
She laughed, the sound made metallic by being transmitted through the sides of their helmets. she said. Daniel thought for a moment, then clapped her on the shoulder. he said. * * *
Daniel had never served on an Archaeologist-class cruiser, and this visit aboard one&#151;even more than his first in harbor on Sexburga&#151;made him thankful of the fact. The Winckelmann had been designed during a period when compartmentalization was the fad among naval constructors. The result was a squat cylinder divided into quadrants longitudinally as well as by decks on her vertical axis.
In theory the Winckelmann could continue to fight with at least a quarter of its strength after a direct hit by a missile anywhere except on the power room. In practice the class was inefficient in action even when undamaged, required larger crew complements than ships of comparable force, and broke down approximately four times as often as less complicated designs.
As usually happens, reality trampled a brilliant theory into the dust. Again as usual, the theory left behind detritus of which the Winckelmann was one of the more prominent clods.
Daniel grinned as a signalman guided him up a third armored companionway, this like the others half-lit and dank with condensate which sometimes formed rust-bright pools along the welded seams. He didn't imagine he'd enjoy this visit to the Winckelmann if she were outfitted and maintained like Corder Leary's townhouse.
said the signalman, stepping aside so that Daniel could enter the H Level rotunda serving the squadron commander. The armored hatch was locked open and showed rust on the hinges. Daniel didn't need a micrometer to tell that the jamb was warped beyond any possibility of sealing the hatch in event of disaster.
Four offices opened off the rotunda; the hatches of three were closed. A senior lieutenant in his late thirties sat at the central console, looking at Daniel with no expression whatever. He spoke into the intercom, his words smothered by the console's active muting feature.
Daniel struck a brace before the console. he said. the lieutenant said. He nodded minutely in the direction of the open office. Daniel stepped into the anteroom of the squadron commander's office, closing the hatch as he'd been directed. Commodore Pettin watched him silently from across the console in the inner office beyond.
Pettin was wearing Dress Whites, just as Daniel was. Daniel didn't know precisely how to take that, but he supposed he'd call it a good sign. Optimism didn't cost anything, after all.
Daniel strode through and stopped two paces from Pettin's console. The room was as bare as a cell. He drew a deep breath and was a heartbeat short of announcing himself.
the commodore said. He didn't sound in the least friendly, but neither was he snarling. Daniel hesitated. There were two chairs on his side of the console, to his right and left, and he didn't know which would be the better choice. The less bad choice. Besides, the paranoid part of his mind was in control at the moment, and it had no difficulty in imagining Pettin having him court-martialled for sitting down before saluting and announcing himself.
the commodore said. Daniel plopped into the chair to his right. His 1st Class trousers didn't strain the way they usually did; marching across South Land on cold rations had been good for his waistline.
There was a moment's silence. Knowing the risk he was taking, Daniel said, Pettin said, not unpleasantly. Daniel folded his hands over the saucer hat in his lap. he said.
Pettin said, Daniel's mind mulled the response, but he didn't let the words reach his tongue. This wasn't the time to play safe by keeping a low profile; if there was ever such a time.
Daniel said, The commodore laughed: briefly, high-pitched, and as bitter as wormwood. he said. Pettin formed his right hand into a fist but he didn't slam it against the top of his silent console as Daniel thought he might. He looked old and very weary.
Pettin said. He relaxed his fist. Daniel said. Pettin nodded. he said. Daniel nodded. he said. This is as good a time as any will be. . . . the commodore said, showing for the first time during this interview the petulance that had been so characteristic a part of his personality during Daniel's past meetings with him. Daniel said truthfully, though the statement would be news to the admiral who was its implied source. Pettin snorted dismissively. he said. Daniel sucked his cheeks in. Nothing he could say would have a desirable effect on the commodore.
Pettin saw and understood the expression. he said with more analysis than rancor, Pettin's face twisted into what Daniel with difficulty identified as a smile. he said. Daniel dipped his head to show that he'd been listening, but he said nothing. He'd had his share of stupid urges in life, but none that would be as insane as encouraging the commodore to open his heart about the way his career had proceeded.
Pettin grimaced and drew himself up straighter. he said briskly, He smiled at Daniel. It hadn't been a question in so many words, but Daniel knew better than to ignore it. he said.
Pettin said, obviously relishing the situation. Daniel said carefully.
As though Daniel hadn't spoken, Pettin continued, Daniel said. Petting said, Daniel smiled faintly. he said. Pettin said. He waved toward the hatch. Daniel froze. he said in a voice he hadn't meant to use, Pettin grimaced. he snapped. Daniel stood, saluted, and walked out of the cabin as quickly as he could without running. He reclosed the hatch behind him; he'd had no orders on the subject, and it certainly made him feel better to know that there was a steel panel between his back and the commodore.
He threw a smile toward the startled lieutenant at the console. Daniel regretted being sent to Tanais for the crew's sake, but to be perfectly honest the recreation available there was about what most of them would have chosen on Strymon proper.
Adele might miss the lack of museums to tour, but Daniel was pretty sure that her real work was expected to begin after she reached the Strymon system. She'd be very busy, and the heart of a naval base was at least as suitable a site from which to send out electronic tendrils as the capital would be.
As for Daniel himself, even two weeks on Tanais would be a vacation compared to the run from Cinnabar to Sexburga. He could take it easily.
And it was a great improvement over the career-ending efficiency report that Pettin had probably planned to issue at the time the squadron lifted from Sexburga.

CHAPTER TWENTY-TWO
Adele echoed the right half of Daniel's display&#151;a schematic of the Strymon system rather than the astrogation data on the left portion&#151;as a sidebar on her own screen. Frankly, the icons on ghostly orbital tracks didn't mean a great deal more to her than the abstruse mathematics of Matrix navigation, but she knew Daniel would want to walk her through the display when he had a moment.
Her communications board was as silent as a snake waiting for prey. Within the Matrix, there was nothing to hear but static; so the experts said. Though sometimes the static formed patterns that almost mimicked communication.
Once Adele imagined that she heard her sister calling, After that she no longer listened to her equipment until the Princess Cecile reentered normal space.
Betts called from the attack console. His display was a mass of overlying curves in many colors.
Adele checked for curiosity's sake and found that the missileer had set up twelve separate attacks for each of his pair of launchers. The first factor in each equation was blank. The actual courses would be determined when the Princess Cecile exited the Matrix and thus had a location in the sidereal universe.
Daniel said. He leaned back in his chair, watching his display but obviously not called on to act at the moment. There was general laughter on the bridge. The corvette was noisy with preparations for its return to sidereal space, but the spacers were talking normally instead of using the helmet intercom. Adele found communication systems interesting, though she felt a mild surprise whenever she remembered that she was no longer merely an observer.
rumbled the PA system in Lt. Mon's voice.
called Daniel. Adele said, careful to speak loudly so that she'd be heard. She was vaguely curious about the place they'd be spending the next two weeks, but not nearly as interested as Daniel was in informing her. The layout of the Strymonian naval base was a matter of record. What Adele had been sent to the system to learn was of a subtle and immaterial nature, not concrete and tunnels.
Daniel said, now switching to intercom to keep private a conversation of no general interest. Carets of red light stabbed into the display. A constellation of nuclear mines in orbit, each ready to punch a light-speed rod of charged particles through a hostile vessel.
said Adele to indicate her presence. As she listened, her wands called up a catalog of the frequencies and codes on which the Tanais forts had operated in the past. The information had been gathered by visiting RCN vessels over six decades.
The Strymon fleet didn't pay nearly as much attention to communications security as it should: when a code changed, it generally reverted to one that had already been used in the past. The pirates who were the main threat to Strymon apparently didn't concern themselves with signals intelligence.
Daniel continued. His highlight this time formed a tiny sphere in the blankness, trundling slowly across the screen in concert with the large, peach-colored Getica and the smaller, bluish ball that was Tanais. Adele created a probability rota for codes and frequencies. There was no reason to hunt for a solution if one were already at hand. With the algorithms Mistress Sand provided, the Princess Cecile's main computer could turn any intercepted transmission into plain speech within minutes if not seconds, but even short delays could be significant.
A quarter second was enough time for Adele Mundy to draw her pistol and fire a pellet into the brain of another human being, for example; even less on a good day.
Mon announced.
Daniel went on in sudden concern. Adele said. Her wands quivered, putting her question into electronic form almost without her conscious volition. Data sprang to life on her display. Daniel said. The intercom didn't transmit his chuckle, but she heard it faintly from across the bridge.
Adele said. She allowed herself a smile, though there wasn't a great deal of humor in it.
Her work for Mistress Sand would be mostly archival. Conspirators&#151;competent ones, at any rate&#151;would shut down their operations while a Cinnabar squadron was in port, but there would remain vestiges of past activities that they couldn't remove even if they realized the need to do so.
Tanais would have a supposedly secure link to all government databases on Strymon proper. Adele would tap it within a few hours of the Princess Cecile's arrival. Sorting for evidence of treachery would take time, but she was confident that before the squadron was ready to leave the system, the only thing that would prevent her from finding what she was looking for was total innocence on the part of Pleyna Vaughn and her government.
Adele's smile grew minutely broader without gaining much in the way of humor. She didn't believe in innocence as a concept, save perhaps in children like her late sister, Agatha.
Any responsible government in Strymon would have opened lines of communication to the Alliance. But if the present one had done so, its members would go the way . . . Agatha, say, had gone. Damned if you do, damned if you don't.
Mon said. Tones echoed themselves up and down the Princess Cecile's corridors.
Daniel said. In his official voice he continued, The starship shuddered in a pattern that had by now become as familiar as Adele's nightmares and very nearly as unpleasant to experience. Colors inverted to their visual reciprocals. For an instant Adele saw not one compartment but an infinite series of compartments, each identical&#151;almost&#151;to the others.
She kept her eyes open. She'd tried closing them the first few times, and the result was even worse.
Another shudder. It was as disconcerting as the previous series even though Adele's conscious mind knew that when she was growing up this was the only universe she'd ever expected to know.
a spacer shouted. Over the intercom, Lt. Mon bellowed, Adele heard the cheering with a distant part of her mind. The rest of her, body and soul, was busy with the glut of information the Princess Cecile's communications suite was gathering.
Signals Officer Mundy was at work.
* * *
Daniel said, feeling expansive. Daniel was glad that Lt. Mon had told the crew about how precisely they'd exited the Matrix, because otherwise he might have said something himself. Daniel didn't like boastfulness, in himself or in others, but there were some things so uniquely wonderful that they shouldn't pass without comment.
an agitated voice said after more than the normal lag for communications over a 70,000 mile separation. Daniel frowned, the expression of an RCN officer and Cinnabar nobleman who'd just been told what to do by wogs. He glanced at the course schematic which had replaced the astrogation display when the corvette entered sidereal space. The Princess Cecile retained considerable velocity from the bubble universe from which it had exited. The High Drive was braking at .5 gee, the hardest a reasonable captain would stress a vessel with its sails set.
Lt. Mon had laid out a complex powered orbit that would bring the Princess Cecile around Tanais alone instead of looping the primary. He'd calculated it to give them time to scrub off momentum during the expected bureaucratic delays an unannounced vessel could expect before being assigned a berth.
The present business was not at all to be expected.
Daniel said. He was handling the communications chores himself, both because he was more familiar with procedures than Adele and because her specialized skills could be put to better use at this moment than routine. His hand reached for a red button set into the material of the console; not a holographic construct. Before he touched it, General Quarters chimed through the corvette: Lt. Mon in the Battle Direction Center had been a hair quicker than his captain.
said the controller. He sounded as though he was on the verge of a coronary or a nervous breakdown. The bridge whispered with the motions of officers focusing on their individual domains. In the corridor the riggers who'd come in during exit&#151;it was possible to make the transition with crewmen on the hull, but physical and psychological disorientation made it very dangerous for them&#151;were locking their helmets shut in obedience to Woetjans' order over the intercom.
Daniel switched the left half of his display to a real-time image of Tanais. The corvette's course had already brought her within the forts' interlocking orbits. The whine of the High Drive gained in volume as it maintained balance between the conflicting pulls of Getica and of the smaller but closer satellite. Tanais Base was a scrawl within the ice sheet, visible from diffracted light. Thermal imaging would make the tunnels even more evident.
said a new voice: male, forceful, and very determined. Good God, there was a heavy battle squadron down there! Not in the base proper but on the ice on the side of Tanais which eternally faced Getica.
Daniel said as his fingers typed preset emergency codes. The first of them returned control to the command console from the Battle Direction Center. Lt. Mon might be able to handle this as ably as Daniel could, but it was God's truth that they couldn't both be responsible at the same time.
If Daniel had had time, he'd have prayed that he didn't miskey . . . but if he'd had time, he'd have been able to check his work. said Adele's voice over the intercom. She didn't sound nervous but her tone was as joyless as a slaughterhouse. With the command console locked down the way it was, no one should have been able to break in. No one but Adele could have.
Daniel shouted. That probably startled Tanais Control, but a lot of people were getting surprises today. Daniel's left hand chopped the High Drive while his right engaged the sequence that would return the Princess Cecile to the Matrix.
Daniel said. The forts each mounted eight-inch plasma cannon in turrets on the north and south axes. The Princess Cecile's course had carried her planetward between two of the forts. Their guns fired as pairs within microseconds of one another. The bolts&#151;dense, thigh-thick gouts of charged particles&#151;tore through vacuum a hundred yards behind the corvette. They made their own light, like sections ripped from a star's corona.
Daniel could feel the Princess Cecile start to shift out of sidereal space. The hair on his neck tingled and a trembling in his gut mimicked the onset of panic.
The forts missed because Daniel had shut off braking thrust as he prepared to reenter the Matrix. The gunnery computers calculated lead based on the rate of change in the corvette's progress&#151;and therefore fired short. The delay between discharges for heavy cannon was fifteen to twenty seconds; otherwise heat buildup in the chamber would cause a catastrophic failure when lasers compressed and detonated the second tritium pellet. The Princess Cecile was safe from the guns that had already engaged her.
The third fort came around the curve of the satellite on a combination of the corvette's momentum and the fort's own orbital velocity. The Princess Cecile's vector above the surface of Tanais carried her directly toward the fort, giving the guns a zero-deflection shot.
Sun couldn't fire his own pairs of four-inch cannon because of the Princess Cecile's sails. When set they draped the hull like shrouds and would absorb the vessel's own discharges in fiery cataclysms.
the gunner said, shouting because words were the only response he could make to a situation he appreciated even more clearly than his captain. Two eight-inch plasma bolts ripped through the portion of the Princess Cecile which hadn't yet trembled out of sidereal space. Their scouring impact flared across Daniel's display.

CHAPTER TWENTY-THREE
said Daniel in a pleased tone, leaning back in his console.
The words and tone were perfectly predictable, Adele thought as she looked across the crowded bridge at the captain. Daniel would say the same thing&#151;and mean it&#151;if he'd just had both legs amputated. If Daniel Leary had a motto, it would be While there's life, there's hope.
On duty, at any rate. Off duty his motto would probably involve the age of suitability for girls.
Adele smiled faintly. Her own motto would be more along the lines of While Daniel's alive, there's hope. The Princess Cecile's crew was a normal assemblage of human beings, some more sanguine than others; but not a soul of them would disagree with Adele there.
Woetjans and Pasternak stood in the center of the bridge. Even without Betts and Sun at their consoles&#151;they were on the hull, checking the launcher hatches and gun turrets respectively for external damage&#151;the chiefs of rig and ship filled the compartment. Condensate dripping from metal fittings of their rigging suits shrouded them in a clammy reminder of the environment from which they'd just returned.
Woetjans said. said Pasternak. He glanced at the lowering Woetjans.
Woetjans grimaced, but she nodded agreement.
The corvette was full of noise. She was double hulled, and the cavities held spare rigging along with other stores which cold and vacuum wouldn't affect. The sound of hollow steel spars being withdrawn through the outside hatches rang within the hull like a tocsin.
Adele's screen quivered with pairs of conversations, sometimes a dozen at the same time, as spacers assessed the damage and started repairs. The Princess Cecile hung in normal space. Sun and Gansevoort had inserted intercoms from the internal helmets into prepared sockets in the riggers' suits, though Adele as Signals Officer had to activate each unit before it could be used.
A low-power radio signal on the hull of a starship in the Matrix would distort navigation by many light-years and in theory could rip antennas out of their steps. The Princess Cecile wouldn't be returning to the Matrix any time soon, however, so Daniel had approved his chiefs' request for quicker communications on the hull.
Lt. Mon entered the bridge, slipping between Woetjans and Pasternak without touching either of them. he announced. He glared at Woetjans. Mon always looked angry, on the verge of a snarling explosion. From what Adele had seen of the man, his normal expression accurately described the personality beneath.
Despite that&#151;because of it?&#151;Mon's bubbling anger in a crisis was just as bracing as Daniel's cheerful insouciance. No one seeing either man could imagine they thought there was anything to be afraid of in the present situation.
Woetjans agreed. She shrugged. Mon snapped. He rotated his glance around the room in search of anyone to deny his statement. Adele met the look with a cool frown; Mon's attitude affronted her, foolish though she understood her reaction to be.
Daniel said with a reminiscent smile. Woetjans said, Her voice changed, growing noticeably brighter.
Daniel said without losing his smile. He looked at his officers, his face quite different from that of the man with whom Adele shared a two-room suite and who chatted about natural history and girls. His hand touched a key. In the air between him and the standing officers&#151;Mon and Woetjans stepped back&#151;appeared a holographic image of six starships against the icy surface of Tanais.
Daniel said. Mon muttered, Daniel said. His tone was neutral, but Mon heard the reproach in it and colored. His lips formed a silent apology.
Daniel continued, Everybody nodded. Adele didn't need Mon's editorializing to realize that the same could be said about the crews of Commodore Pettin's three vessels.
Daniel said. Woetjans said. Mon said. Daniel said, Adele said. Her wands called up the data she'd swept from the electromagnetic spectrum during the corvette's minutes in the Strymon system, then sorted it according to times and naval slugs. Among the officers behind her swirled a discussion of the danger even to a cruiser if she tried to lift with hostile frigates in orbit above her.
Tanais was 712 million miles from Strymon&#151;somewhat closer to their common sun&#151;when the Princess Cecile had approached the base. Rather than using the relay satellites, routine information was passed by courier vessels which shuttled back and forth through the Matrix, using microwave to cross the final 100,000 to 250,000 mile leg instead of landing at either end. Adele's data included the latest pair of transmissions.
It struck Adele that the crews of the courier vessels probably found the duty very boring; though her realization was based on what the spacers she served with would feel rather than any personal distaste for such duty. So long as Adele had a sufficient database to occupy her, she really didn't care whether she was on the ground or in a ship moving in a repetitive circuit.
Adele pulsed an amber caret across the top of Daniel's cabin-center display. She didn't want to break into the discussion, but she did have information the spacers might need.
Daniel said, interrupting Mon's gloomy assessment of Pettin's chances if he met the Alliance squadron on equal terms.
Adele said, replacing the Tanais display with her own. Amber sidebars hung beneath the holograms of four vessels&#151;101, 122, 124, and 203. Each was the shape of the Princess Cecile and approximately nine-tenths the size.
Adele continued. She frowned. Pasternak said. Daniel touched a key, highlighting in red a line in all four tables. he said.
He smiled, perhaps thinking as she was of the concept of Adele being used to anything naval. said Adele in understanding. Three hundred and twelve rockets apiece, launched in clusters of twenty-four at a time. Mon looked as though he were going to blow steam out of his ears, but Woetjans guffawed and said, Daniel said through his own laughter. His voice trembled a little. Emotion was never far from the surface of Daniel's mind. Sometimes like a porpoise it broke into plain sight when he clearly would rather keep it hidden. Adele smiled with sudden affection.
Woetjans said. She turned her head, looking for something harmless to slap with her gloved hand. There was nothing in arm's reach of where she stood; Pasternak watched the movement with more than idle interest.
Daniel said, his voice almost musical with his effort to keep it calm, He switched the image to a navigational display. It probably meant as little to Woetjans and Pasternak as it did to Adele, but Mon nodded and slipped his visor down over his eyes.
Daniel said, keying a red highlight in the middle of the projected starfield. He grinned at Adele, who hadn't really given the matter thought.
Mon said, showing that he hadn't just been making a show of understanding.
Daniel said. said Pasternak. Daniel said, smiling like a little boy given the gift of his dreams. said Mon. Daniel said. He pressed his palms together and seemed on the verge of rubbing them in the pleasure of his thoughts. Daniel sobered slightly. he said, Woetjans said. She stepped sideways&#151;Pasternak, prepared, gave her room&#151;and slammed the bulkhead between the missile and gunnery consoles with her hand. Spacers passing along the corridor glanced into the bridge in concern.
Woetjans said. Daniel said, his face beaming with anticipation. * * *
The riggers came inside with the thumps and crashing of even greater haste than their usual. Before the inner lock was closed, Woetjans unlatched her visor and shouted, Daniel looked at his display&#151;he'd trust his bosun over whatever the electronics said, but spacers become old spacers by double-checking everything&#151;and saw that the schematic too believed the corvette was rigged for immediate action. The sixteen antennas on the rings nearest the bow and stern&#151;A, B, E, and F&#151;were folded along the hull. That gave free traverse to the gun turrets and permitted missile launches without the risk of losing sails to the antimatter exhausts.
The Princess Cecile would handle like a pig on entry and exit from the Matrix, but this was a hop of short duration: S1, the sun about which Dalbriggan rotated, was noticeably brighter than other stars in a hullside view of the corvette's surroundings. Daniel had entered the system to within 200 million miles of Dalbriggan, then paused to rerig.
Daniel announced over the warning chimes. He felt forces shifting, finding a balance that wasn't of the human universe. The Princess Cecile and her crew entered the Matrix. To Daniel it was the motion of a coin flipping in some fourth dimension, obverse/reverse/obverse/reverse, though he knew others described the experience in very different fashions. The reality was beyond human understanding, so no analogy could be more than partial.
Almost as the Princess Cecile entered, the clock began counting down seconds to exit. The intermediate appearance within the S1 system didn't constitute a risk of detection: the Princess Cecile would be arriving above Dalbriggan before the light of her previous exit had reached observers on the planet.
Daniel ordered, but of course the crew had been at action stations for most of the past hour. Betts and Sun were intent on their displays; Adele alone was watching Daniel. The tension at the corners of her eyes was due to the Matrix, not because of fear of what they would meet when they returned to sidereal space. Vibration at his nerve cores, the feeling of wires drawn to the point of rupture&#151;
Exit!
Gasping, suddenly aware that he'd been holding his breath for the past minute or more, Daniel keyed his transmitter. It was set to 15kH, the hailing frequency here in the Sack in contrast to the 10kH push used generally on the worlds outside.
he announced. They were a hundred thousand miles out from Dalbriggan. They'd returned to sidereal space squarely over Council Field, which the Sailing Directions said served as a capital for as much of the cluster as was under unified control at the moment. It was a dry-land site. Daniel counted thirty-seven ships on the ground, though some of them were probably hulks as incapable of star travel as his own left boot.
None of the vessels was the size of the Princess Cecile, and few were more than half her size. They bristled with light plasma cannon, sometimes in fixed mountings of four and eight tubes like a bank of organ pipes. At close range a rack like that could strip a merchantman's sails in a matter of seconds without endangering the hull and valuable cargo.
responded a voice promptly. There was a pause before the voice continued, Daniel ordered. The bosun had already opened the inner hatch of Bow Dorsal airlock. The High Drive keened, slowing the vessel. Working in a haze of not-quite-complete matter-antimatter cancellation was unpleasant for the riggers, but the quicker Daniel was on the ground confronting the Astrogator, the better. Surprise and the name of the RCN were the best weapons Daniel had at the moment.
Course vectors for landing filled the right half of Daniel's console, set by Lt. Mon from the Battle Direction Center. Daniel switched the real-time display on the left to a Plot Position Indicator. Three vessels were in eccentric orbit around the planet. There was no certainty that they were guardships rather than hulks, but Dalbriggan Control seemed quite competent, albeit eccentric by the standards of more settled worlds.
Betts said as he concentrated on his attack console. The missileer's fingers continued to type in coordinates, though his words had claimed the courses were already planned. Daniel smiled faintly. Obviously Betts shared his belief that the pirates were keeping a proper guard. Instead of replying, however, he said, The schematic showed all the sails were furled and most of the masts had been unlocked. Woetjans would have her riggers back aboard well before the corvette had completed its forty minute orbit.
Daniel was emphasizing his association, the Republic of Cinnabar Navy, rather than the name of his vessel. The folk who ran the Selma Cluster didn't care about ship names, but by God! they knew to care about the RCN.
the controller said. Daniel thought the controller had finished without signing off, but a moment later the voice added, The riggers were thundering back aboard. Daniel checked the landing vectors and nodded appreciatively. A red-outlined overlay at the top of his screen showed the ground plan of the Council Field with the large building along the north side careted. Trust Adele to have information waiting before he needed it.
Daniel said, The whine of the High Drive gave way to the roaring pulse of plasma thrusters as the Princess Cecile braked hard on its way into the atmosphere. Daniel was smiling. He had a good feeling about this one.
Though he didn't suppose he could explain why in words that didn't leave everybody else thinking he was out of his mind.

CHAPTER TWENTY-FOUR
The Princess Cecile came down on the patch of dirt between two Dalbriggan cutters, a hundred yards from the Hall. This was a normal landing place: already blast-scarred and separated by a berm from the Hall which faced it.
meant a berth for a 300-ton cutter, however, not a corvette four times as heavy. The Princess Cecile's plasma thrusters slammed the vessels to either side of her, flinging rocks and clods of baked clay against their hulls.
When the Princess Cecile finally came to rest, Daniel rose to his feet feeling shaken. he said to Adele because she stood facing him. He let his voice trail off because he feared he was making excuses. When a starship landed on water, as Daniel had on every previous occasion, a tilted thruster raised a plume of steam which righted the imbalance gently. From a hard surface, the plasma reflected in a violent shock wave. The Princess Cecile had pogoed from outrigger to outrigger in the half-second it took Daniel to cut thrust by three-quarters.
Woetjans said. The bosun held a stocked impeller and wore a bandolier of reloads besides her equipment belt. She didn't look any more concerned about the landing than Adele did.
Hogg announced. He held the jacket and trousers of Daniel's 1st Class uniform; Tovera, smiling faintly, stood behind him with the shoes and hat. Adele looked at Hogg curiously. she said, an observation rather than an argument.
Hogg said firmly. Adele grimaced&#151;Daniel knew she didn't like the ethnic pejoratives that were universal with Hogg and most of the Cinnabar spacers. She turned up her palm and let the subject drop.
Daniel changed clothes, which mostly meant moving his limbs as directed while Hogg and Tovera stripped off his garments and put on fancier ones. Daniel said. Adele said tartly. Daniel smiled. he said. Adele looked suddenly worried. Hogg said with assurance. Daniel heard the main hatch undogging in a metallic chorus. The bolts withdrew with quick hammerblows that rang through the fabric of the ship. He keyed the PA system and said, he said.
Starting for the companionway, Daniel added, the bosun said as she preceded him. Which amounted to&#151;Daniel looked over his shoulder to see who was following&#151;Adele with Hogg and Tovera both. The pale spider whom Adele used for a servant carried the attach&eacute; case which contained her submachine gun. Hogg had slung a knapsack over his left shoulder; on his right hung a submachine gun muzzle-forward in a patrol sling.
Daniel said, knowing he sounded peevish. If there was fighting at all, it meant that his plan had gone wrong.
Hogg said, wheezing down the companionway behind him, Daniel grimaced but said nothing further. In all truth, a gunfight in the pirate's council hall would be a lot less surprising than the recent attack by the Tanais defenses.
The guards in the entryway were alert, which wasn't entirely a good thing. Daniel had been raised in the country and had handled guns from before he could write in cursive. Most of the spacers were as ignorant of firearms as they were of formal etiquette. There was a real possibility that a tense guard was going to blow a hole the size of a dinner plate through Daniel as he walked down the gangplank.
he said.
Hogg muttered.
said Adele, and even Tovera was nodding with her serpentine smile. It seemed to be a general concern among all members of the community who really knew which end of the gun the slug came out of.
The crewmen of the escort waited in the B Level corridors to either side of the entryway, keeping out of the way until it was time to leave. They jostled as they fell in behind Daniel.
All were volunteers, but virtually every spacer on the Princess Cecile would have joined the party if Daniel had been willing to strip the ship. Those Woetjans had chosen were those she wanted to have at her back in a brawl: mostly big, invariably aggressive, and for this mission armed to the teeth.
The ground reradiated the heat of its recent bath in plasma. The local time was just after dawn, and the blue-white intensity of S1 cast sharp shadows across the Council Field.
Woetjans muttered, nodding in the direction of a circular wall like a well coping, one of six such ranged in a diagonal line across the field. Each was a cluster of hypervelocity rockets which could skewer a starship in orbit.
Adele said primly, Daniel said, wondering if Adele had been seriously considering that. Council Field was nearly a mile square, though the ships were mostly at this end, near the Hall. Houses were scattered throughout in the neighboring forest. Running over bare baked earth to attack the most distant rocket pit didn't strike him as a practical proposition.
He smiled. Woetjans saw the expression and said, Daniel explained. The sky rumbled with the arrival of another starship. The flickering plasma threw faint highlights into the long morning shadows.
explained the intercom in a female voice&#151;Vesey, for a fact. Aircars were approaching the Hall also. As Woetjans led the dismounted party into the opening through the berm&#151;built out in an elbow to block blasts from landings and liftoffs&#151;a big vehicle overflew them at low level. It had started life as a truck, but the addition of armor and pintle-mounted weapons turned it into an assault vehicle of sorts. The Selma pirates attacked settlements on the ground as well as preying on merchant vessels.
The powerful fans buffeted the spacers beneath, knocking some to their knees. It was like being caught in a millrace. Daniel glanced back. Hogg, his feet braced wide apart, held Adele like scaffolding about a slender pole. Grit and larger pebbles bit as they spun about the narrow passage.
Daniel said, using the intercom to make sure of being heard over the aircar's roar. shouted Barnes, who'd driven aircars both as a civilian and under Daniel's command. The aircar dropped below the berm and landed noisily just out of sight. Other vehicles, similar but not quite so extensively modified, came from all directions to join the assembly. Daniel wondered if the car that had hammered them did so not as hazing but because the entranceway was the only place the driver felt confident of getting his overweight vehicle over the berm.
Daniel said. He used the intercom again so that all his crew could hear the calm in his voice. Hogg said. He was genuinely angry, a very different thing from the loud bluster he used to cow people who were frightened by open emotion. Hogg had a cut on his cheek from some jagged bit of debris, though he seemed to be more concerned about Adele . . . who was fine, as her quick nod assured Daniel.
Daniel said, coloring his voice with the hint of superciliousness which never failed to remind Hogg that Daniel was his master in fact. Hogg muttered. said Daniel mildly. Nothing had really happened, of course, but Daniel knew his servant too well&#151;and Hogg knew himself&#151;for either of them to take the matter lightly.
The Hall was the size of a maintenance hangar, built of wood on pilings that raised it three steps above the ground. A sounder of lean gray pigs, Terran stock but feral, trotted along the side of the building in the direction of the garbage dump to the rear. In the lead was a boar who clashed his tusks at the strangers coming through the berm. The pigs ignored the garishly dressed locals swaggering toward the Hall.
Three aircars landed in quick succession. Each driver tried to put his vehicle closer to the Hall's entrance than the other two. What would've been a shoving match in humans meant screaming metal, then a crash like a sack of anvils falling.
Tovera called in a clear voice. Hogg guffawed loudly. Daniel leaned close to Adele and said into her ear, Adele replied with cool amusement.
The Hall's roof had a high central peak and flaring eaves. Though the air was dry at present and dust blew along the ground, the structure gave every evidence of being built for downpours. Which raised the question of refilling the Princess Cecile's reaction mass tanks on a dry field, but that could wait for a more suitable time.
Instead of a door, the whole end of the Hall was open. Daniel looked upward and saw, furled beneath the eaves, curtains of bark fiber to shield the interior in event of rain.
On the broad porch fronting the entranceway stood Dalbriggans in flowing, garish dress. Weapons&#151;knives, guns, and the occasional rocket launcher&#151;were the universal accessory items. More locals joined those already present, not overtly hostile but showing no sign of opening a passage for the approaching Cinnabars.
Woetjans ordered. Barnes and Dasi were the biggest men on the ship, nearly as tall as the bosun and with the male animal's greater muscle mass.
Hogg, short and pudgy, was on the end opposite Woetjans for reasons other than size. He reached into his knapsack, came out with three fist-sized bundles, and began juggling them. That was an impressive trick while walking forward with gear strapped over both shoulders.
The Cinnabars started up the building-wide steps toward the jeering mass of pirates. Daniel saw the locals brace themselves shoulder to shoulder to resist the spacers' impact. Behind them, their fellows leaned forward to add their weight to the line.
Daniel grinned faintly. He wondered when it would be that a pirate noticed that Hogg was juggling&#151;
a Dalbriggan shouted over the catcalls of her fellows. Hogg neatly reversed the flow of his juggling from clockwise to counterclockwise. Three identical items were nothing for a juggler as accomplished as he was. He'd kept the young Daniel amused for hours with up to seven objects&#151;eggs, stones, or the cook's knives, it was all the same to Hogg&#151;in the air at one time.
Now it was blasting charges of metallic hydrogen in zero-zero insulation. Metallic hydrogen had greater energy density than any other explosive, and more shattering power&#151;greater propagation speed&#151;than anything but capacitor-discharge units.
The charges had no fragmentation effect, of course: the explosive's violence would rupture any casing into its constituent atoms. The blast alone would puree everybody on the porch and deafen their neighbors half a mile away.
called a front-rank pirate over his shoulder. Daniel called, though the veterans around him didn't need to be warned. They'd already paused on the second step for the message to spread over the noise of the crowd. A corridor opened through the crowd, caused in part by Dalbriggans going into the Hall ahead of the strangers. The game was over. The locals had pushed, the Cinnabars had pushed back; there was no longer any point in standing out on the porch when the real business would take place inside.
Adele stepped close and said, Daniel nodded. he said with a grin. He felt his grin broaden into a sunny smile. he added. Adele said. Woetjans ordered, starting the party forward again. Hogg had stopped juggling. He slipped two of the bombs into his pockets and held the third in his left hand with his thumb though the safety ring. His grin showed he'd gotten over his ill-temper of a few minutes before.
The Hall had a cathedral ceiling forty feet high at the ridgepole. Clear panels set in the roof lighted the interior during daytime, but Daniel noted that a system of cold-discharge illumination ran along the roofbeams. Though the Hall appeared rustic, its fittings were as advanced as those of the Senate House in Xenos . . . which also held to the appearance of past times for tradition's sake.
The Hall's only furnishings were a curving, five-step dais at the end opposite the opening and a lectern at one side of it. A score of Dalbriggans stood at various levels of the dais, a hierarchy that both Daniel's interests in natural history and his experience in the RCN fitted him to understand. The man alone in the center of the top row was tall, thin, gray-haired, and as surely in charge as Speaker Leary at the height of his power a decade before.
Adele said, speaking into Daniel's ear. She avoided using the intercom except when there was no other choice.
With the spreading nonchalance of water poured from an overturned bucket, locals entered the Hall around and behind the Cinnabars. Occasionally a Dalbriggan would join the leaders on the dais, but for the most part they stood in self-defined groupings on the open floor. At a quick glance Daniel judged about a third of those present were women, though their numbers on the dais formed a lower percentage.
A middle-aged woman in severe black, the only person Daniel saw who wasn't armed, stood at the lectern. She spoke, her voice filling the vast room from scores of speakers hidden in the roofbeams. Daniel turned his head with a smile. he said. The Hall was alive with sound. Woetjans said, her face screwed tight with concern. She held the length of alloy tubing that was her weapon of choice in any circumstances that permitted it.
Daniel said. Those closest could hear them, but this discussion wasn't over the intercom. Woetjans wasn't concerned about status. She simply wanted to be beside Daniel if trouble started.
Halfway up the pillar which supported the roof at the open end was a platform holding a life-sized statue of the man at the top of the dais. It was of gold; not a significant cost increment to a spacefaring nation which could gather metals in any volume in asteroid belts, but nonetheless an untarnishable assertion. Its blue-glinting eyes were faceted sapphires.
Daniel smiled. His father hadn't gone to quite that length, but he would certainly have appreciated Astrogator Kelburney's gesture.
Hogg nudged Woetjans in the ribs. he said. The bosun looked down at him, then barked a laugh. she said, smacking the tubing into her left palm with a sound like a whiplash. Daniel said. Loud enough to be sure that everyone in his party could hear, he added, * * *
Most of the smells peculiar to this part of Dalbriggan were unfamiliar to Adele, but they were pleasant enough. She particularly liked the spicy sweetness that seemed to come from the wood of the Hall itself. The hog-scavenged dump was downwind, a considerable improvement on her apartment in Xenos where the street was cleaned primarily by the heavy spring rainfalls. It wasn't a matter of great concern to Adele, but she noticed it as she noticed many things.
She walked forward with Daniel. Their escort had stopped a pace back, but there was no longer a crush that Woetjans and her henchmen had to muscle through. The Dalbriggans had left room for the escort at the front of the gathering; the space was tight, but the Cinnabars were no worse crowded than the locals themselves.
Daniel declared at the foot of the dais, He'd started out speaking at maximum volume. A hidden directional microphone picked up his words and amplified them around the Hall without need for human effort. Daniel let his voice drop and found that the public address system compensated with no more than a stutter.
He glanced at Adele and winked; she kept a straight face, concerned about what she was to do. This was worse than a formal dinner in the Princess Cecile's wardroom. There at least it was unlikely that she could make a mistake which would lead to the massacre of all her companions.
She smiled, a reflection of the amusement she knew Daniel would express if she'd been able to speak the last chain of thoughts aloud. That wasn't practical, so she had to laugh on her friend's behalf.
said the Astrogator. His voice had a resonance that could have filled the vast building unaided. Daniel took the first step and the second at a measured pace, gesturing Adele along with a minuscule crook of his index finger. he said ringingly, Daniel took the third step, then the fourth; none of the captains already on the dais moved to bar his way. Adele followed, watching her feet. The treads were deeper than she was used to, and it wouldn't help the mission if she were to fall on her face.
Kelburney laughed; it was impossible to tell how much of the humor was real. he said. They took their places on the top level, Daniel to the Astrogator's right and Adele beside Daniel. She turned and looked back the way she'd come. The Hall had very nearly filled during the time it took the Cinnabar contingent to walk its length. There were several thousand people present, more than Adele would've imagined possible from the Hall's forested environs.
said the woman at the lectern. So many people in a single room couldn't be really silent&#151;their breathing alone was a deep susurrus like that of a sleeping dragon&#151;but the voices stilled. A pair of servants came forward.
They were old, and both were crippled: the man stomped along on one leg and a peg, while the blast that scarred the left side of the woman's face had also burned off her arm. She carried a wineskin on a strap over her good shoulder. The man had a gold-mounted cup in his hands.
Adele's face hardened. The cup was made from the brainbox of a human skull. For a moment Adele had permitted herself to imagine that the able use of technology made Dalbriggan a sophisticated planet.
The woman filled the cup, lifting the strap with her shoulder and squeezing the wineskin between her elbow and torso. The man handed the cup to the Dalbriggan on the end of the bottom row. He drank, an honest swallow, and passed the cup to the officer beside him. She drank as well and passed the cup in turn.
Four more had drunk before the last handed the cup to the servants to be refilled. The ceremony continued.
Adele didn't let her mind wander; rather she slipped into a world where no one could touch her. It was a cold place and utterly colorless, but it was familiar to her. She'd spent a great deal of time in grayness since the day she learned that her family had been massacred, leaving Adele Mundy a destitute orphan.
She could function in this place but she couldn't feel a thing; which was generally for the best.
There was a sound in front of Adele. Her eyes locked into focus with those of the cripple offering her the refilled cup. Adele said in a clear voice.
Daniel reached past her and took the cup. The bone was old; yellow on the outside, dark as the wine itself on the inside from generations of use.
said Kelburney. He stepped in front of Daniel on the broad tread and put his hand over the cup before Daniel could lift it. The Astrogator was taller than he'd seemed when the Cinnabars first entered the Hall, and his powerful wrists belied his slender appearance.
Kelburney wore a cloth-of-gold tunic over pantaloons of the same material. His wide belt and crossed bandoliers were scaly leather, sagging with the weight of ammunition, knives, and pistols in open-topped holsters. The weapons showed signs of hard use.
the Astrogator said, Adele stared calmly at the tall Dalbriggan; her mind analyzed the situation as coldly as it would if she were not directly involved. Kelburney's boast that he'd defy a Cinnabar fleet was just that, a boast. The Princess Cecile was the only RCN vessel present, however&#151;and it was quite clear from Kelburney's expression that his anger and determination were real. Tendons stood out on his neck.
Adele smiled. It appeared that the ceremony of the cup was a major aspect of Dalbriggan faith. Well, faith or not, it was equally important to Adele that she not sup with utensils made from human bodies.
she said. The hidden director controlling the parabolic microphone picked up her voice and amplified it so the whole room could hear. As Adele spoke, her eyes holding the Astrogator's, her left hand reached out and slid the pistol from the cross-draw holster at his left hip. She didn't know the weapon, but the range was too great for the light projectiles of the pistol in her own pocket.
Kelburney felt the weight of the pistol withdrawing. He tried to grab Adele's hand. Daniel caught his wrist. The two men remained locked together motionless. Kelburney's expression changed to amazement; Daniel only appeared soft.
Adele said.
She turned side-on to the far end of the Hall, the pistol extended in line with her left arm. She'd been trained as a duelist, not a pistolero.
The audience was shouting, but Adele doubted anyone was going to shoot at her so long as she was standing close to the Astrogator. The captains nearby on the dais were more of a threat, but they seemed willing to let matters take their course. Anyway, Adele couldn't control what other people did.
She could only control the pistol in her hand.
The weapon was stone-axe simple, with only a post and ring for sighting. At this range, a little over a hundred yards, Adele wouldn't have minded holographic magnification; but she'd make do.
The power was already switched to the coils. Kelburney wasn't the sort to let his last act in life be fumbling to take his pistol off safe.
Adele squeezed the trigger as she exhaled, both eyes open. The sound of the room departed like water vanishing down a drain. The front post was sharply focused; her target was a blue glint in a gray-gold blur.
WHACK!&nbsp;
The snapping discharge through the impeller rings was a surprise as usual, accelerating the heavy slug to several times the speed of sound. The pistol recoiled in Adele's hand, the muzzle lifting. It was well balanced, settling back on target as naturally as Adele's own familiar weapon would have done.
The head of Kelburney's statue twisted awry. Whether she'd hit the right eye or not, she'd certainly torn the casting enough that the sapphire flew out of its socket.
WHACK/WHANG!&nbsp;
In her concentration Adele hadn't heard the sound of the first slug's hammerblow on the metal, but she did the second as gold ripped apart. Long splinters, reddish against the age-blackened surface wood, stood out from the post like a halo where the shots had penetrated after striking the metal.
The top of the statue's head tumbled ringingly to the floor. Dalbriggans in the back of the Hall scrambled to get out of the way.
Daniel said, releasing the older man and stepping back. He smiled toward Adele. he added, Adele took the pistol by the receiver with her right fingertips and offered the butt to Kelburney. The flux had heated the barrel to yellow heat in only two shots. It was a powerful weapon, meant to punch through body armor.
Adele said.
The only noise in the Hall was the continuing echo from the commotion moments before. The Dalbriggan officers on the dais drew back with sharp expressions, more tense than they'd been while Adele was aiming the weapon.
Kelburney took the pistol expressionlessly. He looked at the truncated statue, obviously judging the likelihood that he could duplicate Adele's feat&#151;and correctly deciding that there wasn't a snowball's chance in Hell of it.
he said, handing the pistol back to Adele. And what in heaven's name am I supposed to do with a cannon like this? Adele thought; but she took the weapon with a tight smile. That was the politic thing to do, after all, and it was a very nice piece of workmanship.
Kelburney turned to face the assembly and placed his hands on his hips. he said. The shout built from a dozen throats to a hundred; finally the whole assembly shook the walls with its bellowed response. At first there were a few cries of, among the general assent, but as the volume built so did the agreement.
Kelburney raised his arms skyward. The shouting stopped, though the Hall still rumbled with shuffling feet and indrawn breaths.
Kelburney said. This time there was no opposition. The assembly's decision was implicit in its first response; and this would not, Adele suspected, be a good environment for people who recalcitrantly espoused a minority view.
Kelburney gestured Adele and Daniel both close. He shouted into their ears, He gestured them ahead. Others from the dais were already going into the room beyond, though the Hall proper still reverberated with the enthusiasm of the full assembly.
I wonder, Adele thought, if I should ask for a holster and belt while I'm at it?&nbsp;

CHAPTER TWENTY-FIVE
The Sailing Directions said the Selma pirates took slaves along with their other loot, so Daniel was surprised to see that the only servants in the semicircular council chamber were a half-dozen adolescents and the two aged cripples who'd brought the cup around at the assembly. From the freedom with which they bantered with the officers, all were freeborn Dalbriggans.
Adele walked beside him, holding the heavy service pistol as gingerly as a spinster with a baby. She could put it in a cargo pocket since the barrel had cooled by now, or she could lay it on the scarred table. Daniel didn't say either of those things because Adele was as able to see the possibilities as he was; and as with the spinster, there was more than a little pride in her expression.
She leaned close and said, The Astrogator pointed to a seat in the middle of the table and said, Daniel chuckled. He gestured Adele to the chair beside the one indicated and said, The Astrogator snorted. He lowered himself into the chair across from Daniel&#151;handsawn wood of simple design like the others, but the only one in the room with arms&#151;and said without preamble over the sound of the others scraping into their seats, Daniel said calmly, Kelburney said. He turned his right palm out to forestall anything Daniel might try to interject. For the moment at least it appeared the form meant The ships' officers ranged up and down the long table watched carefully as they drank from the mugs servants were handing out, but they held their peace.
Kelburney said. He smiled like a hungry cat. Daniel spread his fingers on the tabletop as he considered the Astrogator. A boy put a goblet carved from rock crystal on the wood beside him; the mahogany-colored fluid foamed slightly.
Taley and the Princess Cecile's riggers could fish and weld spars meant for Dalbriggan cutters into a working set of masts for the corvette; everybody in the room&#151;with the possible exception of Adele&#151;knew that. Kelburney was offering a plausible excuse as a bargaining ploy.
That was fine: Daniel was here to bargain. He smiled back and said, Kelburney called. A door hidden behind hangings at the side of the room opened. Six concerned-looking spacers entered behind the black-clad woman who'd presided at the lectern during the assembly.
Daniel watched the newcomers with no expression. There were things he couldn't permit. If this pirate chief so overstepped himself as to offer Cinnabar slaves in return for RCN help&#151;
Kelburney said. The wariness in his voice showed that he'd picked up on Daniel's change of expression. He gestured to the cripples filling mugs from a tapped keg on the serving table behind him. The young servants offered the next batch of refilled tumblers to the newcomers. Daniel sipped from his own goblet. The beer was dark and more bitter than he was used to, but an RCN officer didn't look alcoholic gift horses in the mouth.
Falassa was the habitable planet of star S2. The Selma pirates had generally operated as a loose sodality which chose its leader in common, with the Council Hall here on Dalbriggan as the seat of government. As the Sailing Directions made clear, there was nothing new about a ship, a squadron, or one of the three planets going its own way for a time, however.
Massacre rather than reconciliation was the preferred method of repairing divisions. Daniel smiled faintly. The Princess Cecile had other important business before it, but he'd hoped when he received his orders that his mission might involve fighting pirates. He could scarcely complain about having his wishes granted, could he?
said the balding forty-year-old leader of the spacers brought in for display. Several of the Sissie's crew had been born on Rohaska. It was a Cinnabar protectorate with a long spacefaring tradition.
Slayter took a deep draft of his beer. He and his fellows were starting to relax at the sight of Daniel in his RCN dress uniform. Though the spacers seemed to have been fed well enough, Daniel could imagine that the chance of being shot on a pirate's whim must have been a matter of realistic concern to them.
Slayter said. He tried to drink again, but his hands had started trembling. he said into the trembling cup. Slayter pressed his arms to his chest and seemed to get control of himself again. Kelburney waved Slayter to silence. He said to Daniel, An officer midway down the table spat ringingly into a spittoon against the back wall. He appeared to be underscoring his Astrogator's judgment of the Falassans.
Kelburney continued, He cocked an eyebrow toward Slayter. The Rohaska captain jumped as though he'd been jabbed with a cattle prod. he said. Kelburney waved his hand; Slayter fell instantly silent. Daniel kept his face still, but he didn't like to see a man being trained like a dog.
Kelburney said. said Slayter. Daniel asked. He lifted his goblet and swirled it, watching patterns in the remaining bubbles while his mind spun skeins of action.
said Kelburney, Horn was the planet orbiting S3. The three stars of the Selma Cluster were within four light-years of one another and followed a common trajectory.
The officer who'd spat before did so again. This time, as the bucket quivered with the hollow peevishness of titanium, the fellow said, Others nodded. Not all did.
Daniel said. Beside him, Adele had her personal data unit on the table beside her new pistol. The display was a pastel blur above the little box.
the Astrogator said. He looked around the room, smiling grimly. he said. Daniel nodded twice while his mind finished its series of considerations. He exchanged glances with Adele; she nodded crisply. He didn't know precisely what she meant by the gesture, but it was clearly positive.
Daniel said. Kelburney said. The spittoon rang again.
Daniel said, sounding&#151;deliberately sounding&#151;like his father addressing clients who'd gotten in over their heads and begged his help. Kelburney's brow furrowed momentarily at Daniel's tone; then it cleared and he slapped the table. he said. said Daniel, letting his own smile widen. He'd been concerned by the Dalbriggans'&#151;by the pirates'&#151;loose discipline, but that clearly didn't extend to operational matters. said Kelburney. Daniel said brightly. said the officer who'd been spitting.
said Daniel, rising to his feet. He beamed at the gathered pirates. He was boasting, of course; but if he hadn't meant the words, he wouldn't have spoken them.
* * *
The armored hatch of the Battle Direction Center squealed as it opened outward into Corridor C. Without taking her eyes from her console Adele said, The hatch started to cycle closed again. Midshipman Vesey looked up big-eyed from the console to Adele's left and said, Oh.
Adele called to the slight opening which remained&#151;a warship's battle doors open and close with enthusiasm. She got up, bumped the edge of the console, and promptly fell on her face because both her legs were numb. She'd sat too long without moving. Dorst and Vesey were helping her to her feet when Daniel stuck his head into the compartment again.
he said. Adele said, Her throat hadn't been so dry since she'd fought her way out of an Alliance prison, breathing dust and air burned to ozone by electromotive weapons. She sounded terrible and probably looked worse. Dorst handed her a drinking bulb. She sucked deeply on it.
Not until the third swallow did she identify the contents as milk&#151;the perfect choice once she thought about it. As Dorst had obviously already done.
Adele said, irritated by the concern in the eyes of her three companions, and even more irritated because she couldn't deny she gave them reason for it. Her knees were wobbling now. Great heavens, what was wrong with her?
said Vesey, Dorst guided Adele back into the seat where she'd been working. She was accessing the ship's computer through the familiar pathway of her personal data unit. The battle computer's great holographic display showed what looked like a twisted circle of ribbon: the track of the guardship Hammer as it orbited Falassa. Date variations were color coded from violet to the deep red of the most recent.
Dorst put another bulb of milk in Adele's hand. Vesey said earnestly, Daniel nodded. he said. He gestured; obediently Adele drank more of the milk. For a moment her stomach threatened to rebel; then the combination of texture and food value went to work and she began to feel better.
She managed a smile. Of course she still had quite a lot better to feel.
Adele said. Dorst said. said Daniel, said Adele. She scowled to hear her own words. Her mind wasn't working any better than her body seemed to be. She'd been lost within the problem, and now that it was solved&#151;her task was complete, at any rate&#151;she couldn't get back to normal.
Adele giggled. Vesey said.
Adele explained. The midshipmen looked aghast, but Daniel grinned at her. he said. Adele said. She heaved herself to her feet again and managed to keep upright this time. Daniel offered Adele his arm. he said, probably a lie. Adele said. The milk had awakened a raging hunger that she'd suppressed while she copied and collated data.
The pirate cutters operated on unique internal clocks, determined either by the whim of the captain or as an accident because the astrogation computer had been shut down and reset to zero following repairs. Though Adele didn't suppose that had added much to the complexity of the operation. Even if they'd all been RCN warships, she would've felt constrained to check each time slug against reported star positions. There was no such thing as acceptable error in her universe.
The galley was on B Level opposite the entryway. Between mealtimes when the Princess Cecile was under weigh it served as a lounge, but usually when the corvette was on the ground the personnel spent their free time in facilities ashore.
Not here on Dalbriggan. When Daniel entered with Adele&#151;the two midshipmen trailed behind like nervous pets&#151;thirty-odd spacers rose to their feet in greeting. Most of them were armed: many with weapons from the arms locker and bandoliers of ammunition, but the others displayed less formal clubs, knives, and in one case a wire garotte.
asked Liebig with a nod of greeting to Adele as well. Daniel called to the spacer who was getting a mug of hot cacao from the mess dispenser. He settled Adele into a table vacated for them and said, Wharnock brought over the meal packet. He stripped the top off with a gush of steam as he set it on the table before Adele. She stared in sudden horror at the bacon, eggs, and grits&#151;and as suddenly felt another rush of hunger. She picked up the spoon attached to the container and began eating.
a spacer asked. Adele didn't notice who spoke; she was balancing the spoonful of egg at the edge of her lips, blowing softly to cool the contents.
another said. Through the chorus of and Daniel&#151;who wasn't eating, as Adele had suspected&#151;said, Adele started on the grits; to the best of her knowledge she'd never eaten bacon, so she was leaving that for last, if at all.
Daniel's outline of politics in the Selma Cluster mirrored Adele's reading of the cluster's history. She smiled wryly. There was a great deal of similarity between Selma and Cinnabar, if it came to that. Her parents would certainly have agreed with that at the end.
Daniel asked. Daniel wasn't asking for a real analysis. At another time, in private, he'd certainly be interested in what Adele in all her different guises thought, but what the two of them were doing now was an exercise in theater to keep the crew's morale high. Though&#151;Adele's private opinion would be precisely the same as the one she offered now.
she said, She tried to scoop up a strip of bacon but decided it must be finger food instead.
There was general laughter, some of it amazed. Every member of the crew knew who Daniel's father was, and by now rumor at least must have identified Adele with the leaders of the Three Circles Conspiracy. In this case by rare exception, rumor was perfectly correct.
Vesey put a steaming mug of cacao beside Adele's meal packet. Adele sipped. She'd have preferred water, but this bitter, stimulant-rich drink was the RCN's on-duty staple; she supposed she'd have to get used to it.
Daniel said, glancing around the room. He nodded.
He grinned broadly. The crewmen broke into appreciative hoots and laughter. More spacers were entering the galley, summoned by word&#151;and how delivered?&#151;that the captain was holding an informal ship's meeting and giving everyone the scoop.
Daniel continued, a spacer muttered. He was far enough back in the room that Adele couldn't have seen him if she'd tried. said Liebig, who'd watched Tovera in action at the Captal da Lund's fortress. Adele munched the last of her bacon. Tovera would be amused.
said Matahurd. The cacao had cooled enough for Adele to finish the mug, though she didn't know that doing so was any better an idea than the bacon appeared to have been. It was staying down for now, but the long-term prognosis was no more than even. She stood, needing to stretch her legs.
Daniel said, rising beside her. There was silence in the galley. Sun, standing near the doorway where he'd just entered with Woetjans, said, Daniel said cheerfully. He gestured Adele to the doorway with a lift of his eyebrows. They exited together, followed by the cheers of the assembled crew.

CHAPTER TWENTY-SIX
Adele clumped down the companionway between two spacers of the escort who'd been equipping from the arms locker. They looked wary, but Daniel was pleased to see that Adele was getting the hang of walking on the boot-polished steel surfaces of a warship's interior.
He was also glad to see Lott and Tavastierna were looking after her.
he said, Adele gave him a smile that could have passed for a nervous tic. she said. She patted the butt of the service pistol belted over her utility uniform in an open-topped holster. Adele wore the weapon in the middle of her abdomen instead of hanging by her hip. There the holster, canted for right-hand draw, would have interfered with her personal data unit in its pocket.
Adele added. said Daniel. Kelburney, having seen Adele shoot, would also appreciate that the pistol was more than a gesture when she carried it. Daniel had said that there shouldn't be any difficulty, and there shouldn't; but he agreed with Adele about the difficulties of predicting the future. He nodded to Woetjans.
the bosun said, sweeping her fierce glare over the ten spacers of the escort detail. Bemish said to general laughter.
Daniel grinned also, but he saw that Adele's expression had tightened. The change was minuscule, something that only a friend would have noticed.
he said, louder than he'd intended. The main hatch cycled open.
Hogg got up from where he'd been waiting beside the berm. He was wearing a broadly conical straw hat, obviously local though not a garment Daniel had noticed the day before.
Hogg said as the heavily armed spacers approached him. He looked at Adele with an unfathomable expression. he said. In Adele's ear Daniel said, Adele shrugged. she said. Daniel's grin was delayed by a moment, but when it came it melted all the concern out of his mind. The RCN's way was to use the tools at hand to achieve victory, and he couldn't complain about the past usefulness of Adele's odd servant. he said.
In a loud voice he said, He looked around the escort. he continued, The bellowing laughter from every throat but Adele's broke the tension. Daniel grinned at his crew. There were good officers who were too proud to make a joke at their own expense, but that wasn't Daniel's style. He kept his pride for other things than his sense of self-importance.
Perhaps because of the laughter, Woetjans permitted Daniel to walk at the head of the party alongside Hogg instead of being surrounded by hefty crewmen like glassware wrapped for shipping. When he saw that the scene on the occupied side of the berm was one of repletion, not riot, Daniel beckoned Adele up beside him also.
he murmured in her ear.
Adele agreed with the dry amusement he'd learned to expect from her. Dalbriggans in various stages of undress sprawled in the doorways of buildings and on crushed-rock pavements which connected them more like the passages of a maze than a street grid. Some held bottles, some twined with or stacked upon one another, and not a few lay crumpled like the dead of a battle.
Other citizens were upright, more of them sitting than standing; the few who walked did so with the awkward deliberation of the aged. Some distance into the forest several voices sang in good harmony about the They sounded cheerful, though their tempo was slower than normal for that standard of spaceports across the human universe.
Servants&#151;well, slaves, to give a thing its right name&#151;puttered about ministering to fallen citizens. The slaves were easily identified by not carrying weapons and the fact they were moving at all. Even so, most of them looked the worse for wear following the debauch.
Daniel said. Hogg said as he stepped over a Dalbriggan with a beatific smile, no trousers, and her fist around a broad-bladed knife. Hogg was leading them toward a squat cylindrical building some distance behind the Hall. Uniquely, this structure was of stone rather than wood. Differences in masonry techniques and the aging of the material used indicated that there were weapons which could blast through thick rock walls&#151;and that they'd done so here in the past.
Adele said, She gave Daniel a tight smile. As the Three Circles Conspiracy was. They skirted a youth cradling the head of a bearded Dalbriggan in his lap, offering sips from a chased metal tankard. The youth's large, liquid eyes followed the Cinnabars warily.
Adele continued drily, She smiled at Daniel again, with as little humor as before. she said, Daniel looked over his shoulder. The youth was still staring after the Cinnabars. There was hunger in his expression, but Daniel wouldn't have cared to guess what the hunger was for.
he said aloud. Hogg said. Daniel stepped into the recessed entrance of the Astrogator's dwelling. Beyond question there were sophisticated sensors and weapons pointed at him, but stains indicated the slit in the roof arch had been used to pour blazing fluids.
Electronics were well and good in their place, but an enemy of Adele's skill could turn them against the original user. A gallon of pitch or napalm, lighted and tipped into the opening, had its uses in the most modern setting.
The door chime was a section of osmium tubing from the barrel of a projectile weapon. Centuries of use had given it a surface like hammered glass. Daniel struck it with the piston rod hanging alongside for the purpose.
he called. The door opened in two halves before he'd finished speaking; Daniel had to step back quickly. Not surprisingly, the Dalbriggan leader used the hatch from a starship's airlock for his portal.
Kelburney was dressed in a spacer's jumpsuit; he wore only a single holstered pistol instead of being a walking arms locker as he had during the assembly the day before. Informal garb for a private gathering, Daniel thought with a smile.
A dozen members of the Council got to their feet in the room beyond. Several held drinks, and the girl who went scampering out of the field of view wasn't dressed for a policy discussion. Nonetheless, the Astrogator and his paramount chiefs hadn't been involved in anything that would've gotten one thrown out of a society party in Xenos.
Kelburney said. Daniel said with a pleasant smile, Kelburney looked at him sharply. he demanded. Those members of the Council who were present watched the principals narrow-eyed, even when they drank their liquor.
Daniel said. He felt a tingling all over his body. This is happening, it's really going to happen! The burly captain who'd been spitting for emphasis during the Council meeting made a gagging sound. Daniel blanked his face for an instant, uncertain of what was going on. Beer sprayed out of the Dalbriggan's nostrils and he slapped his thigh with his free hand.
he bellowed through his hacking laughter. Kelburney smiled as his subordinates laughed. he said.
His expression hardened. In this mood the tall pirate had the look of a saint or an inquisitor. he demanded.
Daniel said, professionally curt. said Kelburney. Over his shoulder he boomed, The burly captain grimaced, then walked through a side door with a gait between a waddle and a saunter. Other members of the Council tossed off the last of their drinks and prepared to leave as soon as Kelburney got out of the doorway.
the Astrogator said with a cant of his eyebrows.
Adele gave Daniel a tiny nod, indicating that the Princess Cecile had already been alerted. he said.
He turned and said, a Dalbriggan called. Daniel looked back over his shoulder but didn't speak. The speaker was Mineo, who'd returned to the main room.
he said.
said Woetjans, lengthening her stride on the way back to the corvette and the shadow of battle.
* * *
Dorst announced from the Battle Direction Center, his powerful baritone deepened and blurred by the ship's PA system. The lights pulsed their version of the warning.
Adele turned from her blank display. The spacers all around her were motionless but as tense as wires stretched to within a feather's weight of breaking. The riggers prepared to go topside, while the gunner and missileer poised to fight the Princess Cecile out of an ambush by Alliance forces or by the Falassans, or indeed by their self-styled Dalbriggan allies.
Daniel was running reentry scenarios in sequence, changing the parameters according to this or that assumed degree of damage from the enemy attack. Similar preparation had saved the Princess Cecile at Tanais when her armament could not have done so.
and yet again Adele realized, with perfect clarity, that if she put her pistol in her mouth and pulled the trigger she would never, ever have to feel that nausea again. The fit passed as quickly as it came. She returned to being Officer Mundy, with things to live for and responsibilities to others.
She smiled faintly, remembering a snatch of ancient dialogue called The commo display was alive with conversations among starships which had emerged within a hundred thousand miles of one another. A dozen ships had arrived already, and more popped into the sidereal universe every few seconds following the Princess Cecile.
Whether the vessels spoke through microwaves or modulated laser, the hull of the receiving ship reflected part of the energy in secondary radiation. The Princess Cecile's sensors and correction algorithms were sensitive enough to turn the leakage into coherent speech.
The splendid RCN communications suite isolated and recorded pairs of conversations. Adele checked each one, finding they were uniformly the chatter of captains seeing which of their fellows hung in space around them. When she'd heard enough to allow the software to review the remainder&#151;there was a new burst of empty small talk every time a ship appeared&#151;she leaned back in her chair and sighed.
Daniel said over a two-party intercom link. Adele smiled. She'd have liked to turn and call her answer across the bridge, but she respected Daniel's desire to keep the discussion private.
she said, letting the intercom direct her words to most recent sender in lieu of a specific recipient. There were more than thirty ships on her display now. They continued to appear, but the rate had slowed considerably.
Daniel said musingly. Adele said, uncomfortable in speaking but unwilling not to say something about a matter of such importance. Daniel said in breezy amazement. Adele said, trying to make sense of what she'd just been told. If this was a head-on attack against a heavy cruiser without surprise . . .
Daniel explained. Adele wondered if that was simply a kindly exaggeration or whether Daniel really did think the movement of starships to and from a planet meant something to her. She sighed. It saddened her to realize that she would never glimpse more than the surface of many subjects which the knowledgable found of great internal beauty.
Daniel said. He chuckled and went on, Adele said quietly. On that at least her parents and Speaker Leary could have agreed.
The matter of Alliance backing for the Three Circles Conspiracy remained, as did Agatha's childish features staring over Pentacrest Vale from the bloody stump of her neck. But that was a long time ago. It was no business of RCN officers Leary and Mundy today.
Adele heard the shudder and clang of hatches closing. The rigging crews had come back within the hull, but they remained crowded into the airlocks in case they were needed instantly. They must have gone topside as soon as the Princess Cecile reentered sidereal space, but Adele's own signals concerns had stifled any awareness of other people's activities.
Daniel said abruptly. His words were light but his tone was as professional as an organization chart. said Adele, trying not to sound hurt. Daniel in his professional persona was no colder than she herself was at all times. Daniel switched from one guise to the other with the suddenness of an axe falling, however, and the experience always took Adele aback.
Her wands highlighted the numbered icon on the display that represented the Astrogator's flagship, a 300-ton cutter like the rest of the Dalbriggan fleet. Identification transponders returned only an alphanumeric without personal information, and the pirates hadn't bothered to supply the codes to their new Cinnabar allies.
Adele didn't need the codes, though she wondered whether they'd been withheld or if the question had been ignored. A matching program combined each alphanumeric with data gathered from eavesdropping on intership conversations.
Daniel said. He'd deliberately keyed the transmission to include Adele, though she would of course have listened regardless. The Astrogator's cutter was a half light-second distant, enough to create noticeable lags in conversation. There was no additional delay, however, before Kelburney's sneering tenor voice replied, On a whim, Adele inset a head-and-shoulders view of Daniel in a corner of her display. He was smiling faintly, perhaps remembering as Adele did that the Astrogator's cloth-of-gold costume at the Assembly was even more ornate than Daniel's Dress Whites.
He touched a key and said over the PA system, The chimes and lights echoed his words. Daniel went on. His eyes in the little inset seemed to meet Adele's. Did he know that she was using the broad bandwidth required for visuals in this completely needless and un-naval fashion? He must, because he winked.
Daniel said. Adele's display whirred; the Astrogator's flagship was relaying the synchronization data to his whole fleet in a single multirecipient burst. Two more icons had joined the forty-three of a moment before, meaning that every ship which lifted from Dalbriggan had arrived within minutes of schedule at a point two light-years distant.
Daniel said on his secure link to Adele, He sounded quite cheerful at the prospect.

CHAPTER TWENTY-SEVEN
Normally entry and exit from the Matrix made Daniel as queasy as they did any other spacer, no matter how experienced. This time he was aware of the sensations but couldn't really be said to feel them. His body had become no more than the apparatus his mind used to effect his plans.
Lt. Mon's voice was saying as the lights pulsed.
The Princess Cecile dropped into consensus reality, then fluttered back into the Matrix like a butterfly with a damaged wing. They'd appeared five light-seconds from Falassa, close enough to determine the guardship's exact location.
The attack console held a hundred preset launch patterns; the final choice depended on where the Hammer really was. Adele's data showed a consistent pattern, but a pattern wasn't a bull's-eye&#151;and nothing short of a bull's-eye would suffice when the Princess Cecile was on the wrong end of such a disparity of force.
Betts was running solutions, one for each of the two ready-launch missiles. Daniel did the same at his command console, not quite so quickly but with an assurance that surprised a dispassionate part of his mind.
Daniel was no longer the Princess Cecile's captain, giving orders to the crew and controlling the machinery which would execute his will. He'd become part of the vessel. His awareness of the rig, of the output from the fusion bottle&#151;even of the hums and clings and whines of the parts working in concert&#151;was subconscious. He no more thought about the commands his fingers typed than he thought about breathing. It was all one, and it was all Daniel Leary.
The display plotted a missile track in red, another track in blue, and between them a streak of purple merging the solution which Daniel and the Chief Missileer had both picked. The attack computer would execute the chosen pair when the Princess Cecile next exited the Matrix. Daniel didn't trust humans disoriented by the transition to launch missiles with the split-second timing this attack required.
Without hesitation, Daniel entered his solutions instead of Betts's.
Betts turned from his console to look at his captain. Daniel was aware of the missileer as a portion of the composition Ship and Crew, but Betts no longer had a separate existence in which his thoughts and fears could have meaning.
Mon had already set up the slight necessary adjustments to the sail plan. He and Daniel together had planned the Princess Cecile's course from Dalbriggan to this point within the S2 system with the attack in mind. Modifications of the charge levels rather than the area and angle of the sails would take the corvette the final stage to her target.
The external electrics of a well-maintained starship operated properly ninety-five times in a hundred. The hydromechanical gears and pumps that moved the masts and sails failed&#151;froze, broke, or simply dragged&#151;ten times as often. On an ordinary voyage the riggers would fix the trouble and the astrogator would compensate for the divergence during the next leg.
Having riggers topside on this hop would condemn most of them to death, although that was a relatively minor concern. After all, an error in the location and vector of the corvette's return to sidereal space this time was probably a death sentence for the whole crew.
Daniel looked at Mon's plan, then raised the charge on both sails of the starboard row by a few milliamps. That would give the Princess Cecile a slight axial torque as she exited the Matrix, spreading her missiles as they left their tubes. The dispassionate part of Daniel's mind realized that this adjustment was why his launch solution had differed slightly from the missileer's. For these few moments, the Princess Cecile was a creature of soul and body, not an object crewed by men.
Daniel engaged the exit sequence on the astrogation computer. he announced. His tongue had wanted to identify him as the Ship. The small part of Daniel's brain that remained objective wouldn't permit his muscles and subconscious to confuse his crew that way. He smiled, amused at himself and trembling with anticipation.
The Princess Cecile began to shiver. Casimir energy squeezed the starship in three mutually exclusive directions, forcing it out of the interstices between bubble universes and back into the universe of men.
Still smiling, Daniel switched from the navigational and attack screens to a simple real-time display. The other data were attempts to predict and modify the future. If he hadn't done his job correctly, there was no future for the Princess Cecile.
Entry into the sidereal universe: gut-wrenching, mind-wrenching. Adele looked across the bridge at him. Her face was that of a crucified saint.
The Hammer filled Daniel's display.
The Umbrans had the reputation of building handsome vessels, but the guardship in its present form looked like a pair of hulks progressing through the breakers yard. The Hammer had been dismasted or nearly so: the lower sections of three forward antennas remained to support the communications gear, and those of the final ring sternward&#151;when a heavy cruiser, the Hammer was an eight-row vessel&#151;were stubbed out to attach a bladder holding additional reaction mass.
As an Umbran heavy cruiser the Hammer had weighed 12,000 tons, but the cylindrical bladder the Falassans had added was nearly half the volume of the original hull. The parts were connected by eight tensioning cables around the rim as well as by fifty feet of rigid tubing, giving the whole the form of an unbalanced dumbbell.
The Hammer was elevating the plasma cannon in her quadruple turrets; the shutters were sliding back from her rocket and missile tubes. Daniel had hoped the Princess Cecile's initial in-and-out appearance would have passed unnoticed, but the Falassan crew was definitely alert.
The corvette's hull rang as jets of superheated steam ejected one and then the other loaded missile from her tubes. The missiles were thirty-foot spaceships containing an antimatter converter, reaction mass and twin High Drive units; exhaust would devour the launchers if they were lighted within the vessel itself.
There was no warhead, though at burnout the missile would separate into four segments to increase the coverage area. When a missile exhausted its reaction mass, it was travelling at a significant fraction of light speed; a warhead, even a thermonuclear device, would add nothing to the effectiveness of a kinetic energy weapon.
The guardship was less than ten miles away from where the Princess Cecile reentered sidereal space. Uncle Stacey would be proud of me.&nbsp;
Daniel said, shouting in an unconscious attempt to speed a process that would take its own time regardless. A matter of seconds, no more, but lives end in a fraction of that. . . .
The corvette had risen into sidereal space, launched her missiles, and now was dropping back into the Matrix like a fish straining to hide again below the surface. The Hammer's turrets couldn't slew on target in the moments available, but her rockets course-corrected by angling their thrusters in accordance with data supplied by the targeting computer. Gas puffed from ports all along the guardship's flank as she fired a desperate salvo.
The Princess Cecile's missiles hit: one grazing the Hammer's stern and then rupturing the tank of reaction mass into a gush of steam the size of a planetoid, the other taking the guardship squarely in the bow. The missiles weren't anywhere close to their potential velocity when they struck the Hammer, but the impact of thirty tons accelerating at twelve gees was enough to smash through the cruiser's hull and out the other side.
The second missile's exit plume was brightly coruscant. Particles of uncombined antimatter from the exhaust raged merrily in the Hammer's interior. The ship's bow canted at an angle to the remainder of the hull, on the verge of separating.
Reentry, and never was the wrenching disorientation more welcome. The guardship's rockets had become a flurry of sparks swelling in the final image on Daniel's display as the corvette departed sidereal space.
Spacers cheered. Betts blubbered with joy; beside him Sun pounded the gunnery console with both hands. Daniel hadn't allowed the gunner's mate to rake the target with his plasma cannon for fear the bolts would interfere with the Princess Cecile's missiles, so he was wild with a combination of frustration and triumph.
Daniel checked his status screen. Dorst was already shouting hoarsely over the intercom, said Daniel aloud, He wasn't speaking to anyone except the part of his mind that analyzed his actions after the fact. It was with surprise that Daniel realized Adele was watching him through the curtain of his holographic display, and that she was nodding in agreement.
He grinned and keyed the PA system. he ordered, hearing the electronic echo of his voice filling the whole of the vessel. Daniel engaged the reentry sequence, set up like the previous two before the Princess Cecile left Dalbriggan. Their exit after launching missiles should have moved them ten thousand miles out from Falassa with zero motion proper to the planet. If they'd sustained damage during the attack, he and Mon would have had to modify the plan; but there'd been no damage.
While the PA system chimed and the crew continued cheering, Daniel allowed himself for the first time to think about the maneuvers he'd just directed. He'd learned the art of precise astrogation from his Uncle Stacey, true enough, but it hadn't been Stacey Bergen who'd showed Daniel how to pick an opponent's weak point and then to press home his attack regardless of consequences.
It was possible that Corder Leary would also be proud of what his son had just achieved.
* * *
Adele grimaced as the Princess Cecile's thunderous plasma thrusters cut in. The High Drive's keening vibration was even more unpleasant in its way, but Adele had found that while working she could tune it out the way she did hunger pangs. The thrusters' thumping bass and the atmospheric buffeting which inevitably accompanied the pulses were impossible to ignore.
Besides, when the ions of the exhaust changed state and recombined, they created omniband interference. Even the commo suite's sophisticated software couldn't sharpen more than a fraction of the transmissions into intelligible form.
Adele continued listening to intership signals, of course; it was just harder. The last of the riggers were stripping their suits off with cheerful animation. Twenty feet farther down the corridor, their quicker fellows were catching the impellers and submachine guns which Gansevoort tossed them from the arms room.
Woetjans, with an impeller in her hand and a submachine gun slung across her chest, pushed her way onto the bridge and stood behind Adele's console. the bosun said. Adele looked up, ready to snarl that she was busy. She looked at Woetjans, who'd spent the critical moments of the attack in a steel box tighter than a coffin&#151;and a coffin indeed if anything had gone wrong. Woetjans, whose present concern was that her riggers get a taste of the Princess Cecile's victory before they went out with small arms to further risk their lives.
Adele said. She blanked her display, then searched the current imagery files for the set in question. she said as her wands flashed. Either midshipman could handle the commo chores; in fact the suite's routing software could probably manage unaided, little though Adele cared to admit the fact. She'd picked Vesey rather than Dorst for the duty because a marksman of Dorst's ability had other uses during a battle on the ground.
Hogg, wearing RCN utilities and a knapsack of munitions, stood close to the command console where Daniel continued to make course corrections and talk with his division chiefs. Hogg carried his own weapon, a stocked impeller. He held his master's equipment belt, which included a holstered pistol, but nobody took Daniel's job to be that of gunman.
Which reminds me. . . . Adele said, keying the intercom, She'd forgotten to sign off, but with Tovera that wouldn't&#151;
Woetjans crooked her finger in a tiny gesture. Adele jerked her head around. Wouldn't matter, she'd been thinking, but in fact Tovera already stood behind the console, smiling faintly. Adele's equipment belt was in her left hand.
Tovera wore a smoke gray jumpsuit with crossed bandoliers of ammunition and grenades. She didn't have the attach&eacute; case because today she carried her submachine gun openly. The weapon was subtly different from those being issued from the arms room: it was of Alliance manufacture, a relic&#151;like the sociopath's training&#151;of the time she served a Fifth Bureau spymaster.
Adele transmitted the guardship's final moments, then called up the series showing the Dalbriggan assault on Homeland as recorded during the Princess Cecile's run back to Falassa in sidereal space. The riggers were topside at the time, taking down the antennas, but they wouldn't have been doing any sightseeing. Apart from informing her shipmates, the bosun might be able to explain details that puzzled Adele.
The second sequence began to run on the display. The imagery had been gathered under high magnification and blown up further by the computer. Adele pointed with her index and middle fingers together at cutters looking like six bright sparks as they appeared from the Matrix in the upper reaches of Falassa's atmosphere.
she said. Woetjans bent to get the best viewing angle. she said. Adele winced at the thought of somebody trying to sodomize the bosun. Just a figure of speech, but an unfortunate mental image nonetheless.
The six Dalbriggan cutters had entered sidereal space with considerable motion relative to Falassa. The rigging that propelled them through the Matrix ripped away in long trails of fire: even the attenuated atmosphere forty miles above the surface was too dense for antennas and sails to withstand at transorbital velocities.
Woetjans said. When Adele first saw the puffs of half-burned gases envelop the Dalbriggan cutters, she'd thought all six of them had exploded. Now she realized that they'd instead launched their full magazines of chemical rockets. She was seeing the exhausts, not the debris of an explosion.
Woetjans said. Adele did see, now that it was explained to her. Adele asked, her eyes narrowing.
Woetjans sneered. she said. Adele said nothing aloud. Actually, it's quite a lot like the Three Circles Conspiracy and its aftermath. But of course Woetjans meant The cutters which had attacked in the stratosphere skipped up from the denser layers of atmosphere instead of trying to land. One disintegrated in a fireball which continued on its previous course like a brief comet.
Woetjans explained; she wriggled her finger momentarily in the hologram, disrupting the five silvery streaks which slashed up and past the vanished cutter. She chuckled. she added.
The remainder of the Dalbriggan fleet appeared in orbit with the suddenness of raindrops spattering a dry surface. Unlike the initial attackers, these cutters had used the Matrix to greatly reduce their relative motion. Plasma thrusters flared, braking them down to Falassa's surface.
Woetjans demanded in a mixture of envy and delight. The bosun shook her head and added, The guardship, wrecked beyond repair but still mostly complete, passed through the image area. Several of the gun turrets were intact. The plasma cannon had been elevating at the moment of the Princess Cecile's attack; Adele noted with surprise that now the weapons were lowered and realigned with the guardship's axis. That meant that portions of the Hammer's crew and armaments were in full working order.
Adele highlighted the guardship in red, using a flick of her wands instead of poking her finger through the image. she asked. The bosun's eyes narrowed. she said, the PA system blared in Daniel's voice. Woetjans straightened. she said. She patted the length of tubing under her belt.
said Adele, rising and taking her own equipment rather than permitting Tovera to buckle it about her. The bosun's cudgel seemed superfluous, given that the stocked impeller would make a satisfactory club if one were required; but more than logic determines the choices one makes when setting out to kill or be killed.
Adele checked the little pistol in her side pocket, making sure that it was still easily accessible. It was.
Daniel asked, adjusting his helmet slightly. He wore his visor down as a matter of course, a practical technique that made Adele feel caged.
Adele said. Sandwiched between Woetjans and Daniel, she trotted toward the companionway. Tovera and Hogg had gone ahead. The corridor was clear: all crewmen who weren't necessary to the immediate needs of the vessel stood on B Level, armed and ready for ground combat.
Daniel explained cheerfully. Woetjans bellowed. The entryway was crowded. If there'd been an attempt to leave an aisle, spacers equipped for ground deployment had filled it like sand in a mold.
In the delay before shoving wider the crack the crewmen tried to form, Woetjans said over her shoulder, If Daniel answered, his words were lost in the blast of the thrusters doubled by reflection from the surface. The corvette bucked violently. Adele would have fallen and then been bounced like a ball except for Daniel's firm hand on her shoulder.
She smiled, an expression she knew by now would have frightened anyone who saw it. In this crush, nobody would.
Even as a child, Adele Mundy had known the fighting would never be over. If there wasn't a battle raging at this place now, there were battles going on elsewhere and would always be battles until there was no longer a species called Man in the universe.
As a child, though, Adele hadn't imagined that she would be one of those who fought.

CHAPTER TWENTY-EIGHT
As soon as the main hatch tilted forward enough to break the seal along the upper edge, smoke and ashes swirled into the Princess Cecile. The automatic impeller fixed to the wardroom hatch on the level above cut loose with a long burst, making the hull ring as it recoiled. An incoming projectile whanged off the corvette's bow.
Daniel shouted. The hatch thumped down in soft soil, rolling up sparks from the weeds and brush ignited by the Princess Cecile's exhaust. A ridge of slightly higher ground supported a grove of trees, but the river a hundred yards north of the corvette flooded often enough to rot the roots of large vegetation on the flats. The road just beyond was built on a levee and made a good blocking position.
Daniel started for the grove, well behind the riggers in his fifty-strong party. They'd jumped while the end of the ramp was still ten feet in the air. The thrusters had baked the ground solid. The mud was more organic than mineral, so the stench was worse than that of a fire in a charnel house.
There was a bright white flash in the direction of the distant spaceport. Almost immediately the ground shuddered, but the crash of rending metal was many seconds delayed. The bow of a pirate cutter tilted up, then toppled again below the line of the causeway. There was no way to tell which side had been responsible for the destruction.
Tovera said. Her cold voice was little changed by the compression of the helmet radio link.
A stocked impeller began to fire behind Daniel, the slugs passing close overhead. He stumbled on a root that remained tough despite the charring. Righting himself he glanced backward. Hogg was seated cross-legged on the top of the ramp. His arms were braced on his knees and the impeller's sling, locking the weapon on target.
Every time Hogg fired, a head slipped out of sight behind the causeway. Sometimes there was a splash in the air behind where the head had been.
Midway between the road and the corvette, the ground was still soggy. Daniel's right boot sank ankle deep, throwing him forward. Spurts of mud and pulped foliage leaped high, drawing a diagonal across the line of advancing spacers. The man to Daniel's right crumpled, holding his belly and screaming. His equipment belt twisted away from him as he fell, severed by the slug.
The Princess Cecile's upper turret roared, raking the causeway with pulses of plasma. The bolts were hammerblows of pure heat on the back of Daniel's neck and bare hands. Several of the spacers fell&#151;unharmed, or he hoped so, but thrown to the ground by the crashing discharges.
Daniel's visor blacked out the flashes that would otherwise have destroyed his retinas. What he saw as he continued to stagger forward was an invisible giant chewing hunks out of the roadway. Wet silt exploded in steam and the dark red flames of carbon; rock ballast blew to glassy shards or white, searing calcium flames.
The Falassan gunfire ceased. Daniel wheezed. Sun ceased fire after his twin cannon had devoured three hundred yards of roadway. Through the smoke of the new fires, Daniel saw people running back toward the town to the south or standing with their hands in the air.
Several of the spacers were shooting wildly as they advanced. They weren't going to hit anything&#151;well, they weren't going to hit any Falassans, though their fellows were at risk&#151;and the locals seemed to have stopped fighting anyway.
Daniel ordered. He thought again about his notion of small-arms training for the crew. There'd have been time for it during refit on Tanais. The Sissies would've been excited to have something real to be doing on a barren iceball. Instead&#151;
Another explosion shook Homeland. An orange fireball lifted a metal roof and a human body. The figure was pinwheeling; the arms and legs had separated from the torso before it all dropped out of sight.
This causeway would make a good target backstop, but this probably isn't the time.&nbsp;
Daniel reached the causeway and stepped carefully into a smoldering divot gouged by the plasma cannon before pausing to take stock. A figure in coveralls sprawled on the road to the right. The only thing moving was the row of ribbons sewn along his seams, fluttering in the breeze.
Adele sat beside Daniel on a chunk of rock fill. Thermal shock had crazed the surface, but either it had cooled or this was another example of Adele's unconcern for her physical comfort. She took out her personal data unit.
Daniel eyed the straggling mixture of woods, wire-fenced gardens, and stone houses to the south. The terrain was rolling, and the houses were generally built in clumps on the higher ground. Earthen mounds raised the two warehouses near the road ten feet above the surface.
Vehicles full of armed personnel moved on the paths between buildings. Even with his visor magnification at 160x Daniel couldn't see any current fighting. Two houses burned sullenly, and occasionally sparks gouted from the spaceport well to the south.
Adele said. Her voice broke in mid-sentence for a cough, but she didn't sound winded. How in heaven's name . . . ? But the method didn't matter, and the information certainly did. Daniel said. He didn't want somebody else's field of view covering his own completely. A compressed image on the upper left corner of his visor would give Daniel the information he required without preventing him from doing whatever might suddenly be required. Shooting an unexpected enemy, for example; though with Adele and Tovera both in the hole with him, that was of vanishingly low probability.
Several hundred people were coming toward the causeway on foot. Were they attacking, or&#151;
Daniel said in sudden horror. Much of the crowd was children, and many of the adults carried infants or toddlers as well. His first thought was that all of them were unarmed, but that wasn't technically true. A number of the figures wore holstered pistols, and one female carried a submachine gun slung across her back. She'd presumably forgotten about it; her arms were stretched out to hold the hands of a pair of three-year-old twins.
Daniel repeated. The Dalbriggan image echoed onto the corner of Daniel's visor provided a travelogue through the streets of Homeland. It was so smooth that he thought for a moment that Kelburney was in an aircar or at least an air cushion vehicle, but the forehull bobbled repeatedly into the bottom of the frame.
The gun was stabilized both in azimuth and deflection. It was mounted in the turret of a car armored so heavily that only a firm connection with the ground could support it. Daniel had briefly confused the smoothness of the sight picture with that of the vehicle itself.
The fighting was over; Daniel wanted to catch the Astrogator at the moment of triumph to have the best chance of succeeding with the next stage of his plan. he ordered. Adele said, looking up with a frown of concern. She must wonder if he believed she was incompetent.
Daniel laughed at the absurdity of the unspoken thought. he said. The ringing whine of the fans lifting the little vehicle out of the Princess Cecile's stern hold followed Daniel's request by only moments. Vesey's voice said, but the driver must have been not only prepared but cued into the command net.
Mon had cut corners to save time his commander might need. Daniel said aloud. To Adele's raised eyebrow he added, Kelburney's gunsight steadied on a low circular structure whose stone walls had a pronounced slope. Immediately slugs from an automatic impeller rang from the car's armor. The heavy-metal projectiles ricochetted with green, purple and magenta sparks, vivid even in full daylight. One round must have struck the turret because the sight picture jolted skyward even as the car backed to safety behind a residence.
Daniel switched away from the remote image and overlaid his visor with a sixty-percent mask showing Homeland's topography. The circular building was nearly in the center of town; it wasn't simply a building but a thick ring surrounding a central citadel.
Daniel said with a grim smile. Woetjans had come over to report. she said. Her tone made the pronouncement sound rather like a comment on the weather. The corvette's small utility aircar landed at the back of Daniel's position. Gramercy, one of the power-room techs, was driving. He showed a gentler touch on the controls than Daniel had come to expect of RCN drivers; but then, perhaps he'd gotten lucky.
Daniel said. He walked toward the idling vehicle. Ash from the recent bath of plasma spiraled in the wash from the drive fans.
Woetjans said. She knew she had to remain here to command the ground party, but her request was as certain as sunrise.
Tovera said as she stepped between Woetjans and the aircar. Daniel got into the front seat beside the driver. He'd never thought he'd see Woetjans with a shocked expression; but he knew exactly how she felt.
* * *
The Dalbriggans didn't have a command channel: they had seven separate frequencies on which subchiefs and their followers gabbled orders and nonsense in their excitement.
Adele said. She used her personal data unit to cue the corvette's powerful transmitters for a multiband rebroadcast, hoping&#151;another person would have thought &#151;the message would reach every one of Kelburney's gunmen.
She'd found seven frequencies. What if there was an eighth that she'd missed, that of a guntruck whose weapons were even now swinging on the jeep?
Adele's mouth quirked in slight humor as she repeated, In that case she was unlikely to live long enough to be tortured by failure. The universe had a kindly side after all.
Daniel switched on the jeep's klaxon as the driver took them low through the streets of Homeland. When the vehicle swooped up on edge to slice between a building and a car with an automatic impeller welded to each of its four corners, Adele wished angrily that they'd lift high enough to hold a steady course across the community.
The thought didn't reach her tongue, fortunately. It had scarcely formed when she realized that would mean a straight course down the throat of the Falassan holdouts. She had her duties and areas of competence; which were different, fortunately, from those of the spacer who was driving.
Adele could hear the sound of gunfire over the klaxon and the howl of the drive fans. A red spark shrieking like a banshee curved out of the sky and banged the car's bow, just ahead of the open cockpit. The driver shouted and jerked his control yoke. Daniel reached past and steadied the vehicle before they wobbled into the building to the left.
he explained&#151;to everyone in the car, but Adele was the only one who might not have known without being told. Adele supposed he was only acting the part of a good commander in calming his troops, but on reflection she couldn't be sure. Nothing seemed to faze Daniel.
Adele didn't care about her own life to speak of, but she found the notion of being snuffed out at random was oddly disquieting. Logically it shouldn't matter whether she was killed by a sniper's deliberation or instead by a few ounces of impact-heated osmium plunging from the sky. She obviously wasn't as much a creature of logic as she preferred to believe.
The jeep rounded a knoll on which stood several houses, one of them afire. The swale beyond was a plaza of sorts with a triumphal arch and a number of plinths from which the statues had been recently shot away. Five armed vehicles parked on the pavement, with a group of heavily armed Dalbriggans hunched behind them.
One of the Dalbriggans saw the jeep out of the corner of his eye. He shouted and leveled a stocked impeller.
Tovera lifted slightly to aim: the light pellets of her submachine gun wouldn't penetrate the windscreen of the open car. Before she could fire, Daniel rose to his feet and raised his hands high.
Daniel shouted, keeping his balance even though the driver reacted to the threat by landing in what was virtually a controlled crash. Kelburney stepped forward, holding a drawn pistol. The man with the impeller looked hesitant and didn't lower his weapon. Kelburney backhanded him with the pistol butt from behind, knocking him face-down to the ground.
he shouted, advancing to give Daniel a bear hug. In the assembly, Kelburney had been a monarch; in the council meeting later he was the canny man of business. Here on this field of smoke and blood, Adele saw a much more primal figure that she suspected was the stuff from which the Astrogator had molded his other personas.
Automatic impellers opened fire from somewhere out of sight. Projectiles bounced skyward like a neon fountain. And where are they going to come down? Adele wondered, but with detached curiosity. The near miss had inoculated her against fear of death from that sort of randomness.
A white flash lit the sky to the west. There was a sharp explosion and the firing stopped.
Daniel said, pointing in the direction of the shooting. The air stank of ozone and smoke from burning fuels, plastics, and flesh.
said a hulking gunman. The folk around Kelburney now were bodyguards, not the officers of his inner circle. Those folk would be directing their own contingents of fighters, here in town and back at the spaceport.
Daniel said in a cool tone and a glance that meant, He cleared his throat and continued to Kelburney, Several automatic impellers opened fire simultaneously. Orange flame mushroomed over the houses, lifting a gunshield from one of the makeshift fighting vehicles. The firing stopped.
Kelburney said, his brow furrowing. His expression changed into a cat's smile. he said. Daniel said. Ah! Adele understood now. She sat on a cracked marble paver and began setting up the link. She'd use the transmitter in the Astrogator's command vehicle rather than going through the Princess Cecile's communications suite. The personal data unit was close to the limit of its unboosted range for reaching the ship from here in the middle of Homeland.
Kelburney laughed. he said, Daniel dusted the breast of his tunic with his fingertips. he said, Adele nodded, her wands flickering. There were three separate nodes connecting displays in the Falassan strongpoint. She wanted to be sure Daniel's address would blanket all of them.
Kelburney said. Daniel said, every inch a Cinnabar aristocrat again. Adele asked. She nodded.
Daniel said. He squared his shoulders unconsciously and faced westward, although there was a hill and a building between him and the Falassan headquarters.
Adele made a final adjustment. She'd opened the circuit by aping the power management commands of the Falassans' standby batteries. That portion of the system had no safeguards whatever in place, but it was connected through the transmitter to every computer inside the stone walls.
she said. Tovera was looking at Kelburney with much the same smile as if she watched him over a gunsight. Adele's display gave her the image of the operator seated at each of the seventeen separate units within the fortress. Six were gunnery displays controlling the weapon emplacements in wall turrets, and five consoles were unused at the moment.
At one of the six remaining sat a woman in her mid thirties. A scar ran from her chin into her scalp, skirting her left eye by very little. Her hair was a bright, artificial red except for where it grew over the scar; there the dye didn't take.
she screamed to someone out of the image area. Even without the scar, no one would have called Aretine attractive. Her features were too sharp, and her eyes glinted like the points of icepicks.
Daniel said. He'd instinctively raised his voice, though of course Adele was controlling the volume of the output speakers. She'd turned the command circuitry to her own purposes. Short of shooting the units to pieces, the Falassans couldn't affect their own equipment.
Daniel continued. Aretine and a muscular young male with a metal pincer in place of his left hand were trying to block the electronic intrusion from separate consoles. They had as little success as they'd have had gnawing through rock. The Falassans at the other consoles, including three which had been unused until Daniel began to speak, listened intently to the proposal.
Daniel said. He turned his head toward the Astrogator. Daniel's expression left no doubt in Adele's mind that he meant his words in the most direct sense possible. If Kelburney went back on his word, there would be Hell to pay. A Cinnabar gentleman had promised as much.
Kelburney probably understood the terms being offered and the price that would be exacted for noncompliance on his part. Tovera certainly did. She smiled like a statue of ice as her eyes counted the Dalbriggans nearby; the targets, it might be, that she would kill in a few minutes. For the moment, her submachine gun slanted up at an angle that threatened no one.
Daniel said. Aretine had left her console. As Daniel spoke she reappeared at one of the gunnery displays, wrenching the man there aside and sitting down in his place. The unit was supposed to control three of the automatic impellers in unmanned barbettes on the outer wall. It was as dead as a pile of gravel now; the Falassan commander jerked at the joystick uselessly in frothing fury.
Adele frowned, realizing that she could have shut down the fort's active defenses much sooner than she did, thus saving lives among the Dalbriggan attackers. Though . . . looking at the thugs guarding Kelburney, that wasn't a prospect for which she could summon much enthusiasm.
Daniel continued. He sounded utterly sincere, but he winked to those watching him from the interior of the fortress. They'd have thought he was simple-minded if he hadn't. The Astrogator looked down at Adele. he said. Adele said, keeping her tone neutral. If another Cinnabar aristocrat had spoken to her in so brusk a fashion, she would have called him out; but Kelburney was clearly being polite in his own fashion. The custom of the country. . . .&nbsp;
Kelburney said, He nodded toward Tovera with a grim smile. Truly, the Astrogator wasn't a man who missed much.
Adele pulled off her RCN helmet and tossed it underhanded to Kelburney. she said.
Kelburney muttered as he settled the helmet on his head. The lining adjusted automatically to his larger skull. He nodded toward Daniel, engrossed in the interplay visible through the fort's seventeen displays. Adele said. On the range of miniature screens monitored through the personal data unit, the one-handed Falassan turned with a snarl and grabbed the bell-muzzled weapon beside him. Three splashing holes in his chest flung him back into the console. It went dead when a second burst ripped through the man's body and the box itself.
Kelburney said. Aretine was no longer visible. The Falassans weren't looking at their displays; some of them remained at their consoles, but they'd rotated the seats outward and held weapons ready. Sparks crackled from the wall in front of an unused display, submachine gun projectiles disintegrating on concrete.
Kelburney gave Adele a lopsided grin. he said.
She shrugged. she said. Kelburney squatted beside her, his eyes on Daniel who appeared oblivious. Kelburney said.
Three Falassans carrying pistols ran through the image field of the console at which Aretine had sat when Daniel began his speech. One of them threw his hands in the air and toppled forward.
Adele lied in a conversational tone. Kelburney said in amazement.
Daniel walked a little apart as though he were completely lost in the events within the fort. He and Adele hadn't had a chance to plan this, but from their first meeting they'd shown an aptitude for counterpointing one another. Now, if only Aretine will hold out for a few minutes longer.&nbsp;
Adele said. She nodded in the direction of the fighting with what she hoped was a good-natured smile. Good nature wasn't a subject on which Adele Mundy had a great deal of experience.
she said. A Falassan inside the fort began shouting into what had been Aretine's display. His bearded face was contorted with emotion. Adele had shut off the sound pickup along with all the unit's other functions.
said Kelburney without inflexion. The Falassan gave up trying to speak into the console. He and a fellow reached down and together lifted Aretine by the hair into the image field. The rebel leader's eyes bulged and dribbles of blood ran from her ears. She'd probably been shot in the back of the head, but it was impossible to tell from this angle.
the Astrogator said with a curt nod to Adele. He took off the RCN helmet and returned it to Adele as Daniel came sauntering back. Several of the bodyguards started shooting gleefully at the sky.
Daniel said, shouted a Dalbriggan who had a direct view of the fortress.
the Astrogator said. Adele sighed, gathering her strength to stand up again. She and Daniel had saved quite a number of lives by ending the battle in this fashion. She supposed she should feel cheerful.
But the air stank of blood and destruction, and Adele felt only disgust&#151;at herself and at the species of which she was a part.

CHAPTER TWENTY-NINE
Daniel said as the glum-faced merchant captain walked up as he surveyed the Princess Cecile. Daniel judged that the corvette was about three hours short of being able to lift with her rig in inspection order, but Woetjans had surprised him in the past with the speed her crews could work. Of course the readiness of the Princess Cecile wasn't the question that most concerned him at the moment.
Slayter said. said Daniel, sauntering toward the corvette's stern. It hadn't escaped his notice that Slayter referred to the Dalbriggans as implying Daniel was responsible for their actions or inaction, nor had he missed the swipe at RCN crews paid by taxes and tribute.
The Homeland spaceport was a plain blasted to purplish ceramic by thousands of starship movements. Canals fed by the river to the north crisscrossed the land and provided reaction mass, but the Selma pirates didn't favor water harbors the way most starfarers did.
Their cutters didn't sink deeply into bare soil as heavier vessels would, but there was another practical reason why the pirates weren't fussy about where they landed. Besides capturing ships as they exited the Matrix, the Selma cutters raided outlying settlements where starships didn't normally land. They were used to the tricky business of landing on hard ground, and the practice they received at home made them less prone to error when repeating the process under fire.
Slayter said, following Daniel. Well, there hadn't been much chance the Rohaskan would take the hint of a turned back and leave. Other people&#151;though not many RCN officers, come to think&#151;might have apologized to Slayter or defensively brought up the civilian's promises during the council meeting. Daniel turned like a gun training and said, An aircar overloaded with hogsheads of liquor flew across the field from the south. Its four fans were lugging in synchrony, so the vehicle's progress toward Homeland was a bass thrum . . . thrum . . . thrum . . . A naked man danced on the cargo.
Daniel said. Slayter had started to speak, but Daniel continued raising his voice to keep the floor. He took a step toward the civilian. Slayter held his ground momentarily, then stepped back.
Daniel continued, Daniel placed his hands on his hips and glared at the civilian.
said Slayter, who'd shrunk six inches during Daniel's polemic. He knew the penalties for treason to the Republic, and he must have suspected that Daniel was willing to execute them&#151;and him&#151;out of hand. Daniel beamed. he said, again a picture of friendliness. Slayter quivered between relief and resentful anger. Above on the hull Woetjans bellowed, Daniel glanced up. A team was stepping a new mast, the last of the six being mounted. They'd used the hydraulic winch to get the heavy tubing roughly into position, but the final adjustment had to be made by hand. Five riggers were hauling on a six-block tackle, while the bosun herself knelt holding the pivot pin in place with her left hand and a heavy maul short-gripped in her right.
The maul crashed down like the impact of a slug.
Woetjans stood. She saw Daniel watching and waved her maul in triumph. she called. Daniel waved back. That was only true, he suspected, if he lifted with crewmen on the hull reeving the last of the cables and mounting the sails. But if he gave those orders, neither Woetjans nor any of her riggers would complain about the danger.
Slayter had used the distraction to head for his freighter in the berth across the canal to the east. When Daniel moved the Princess Cecile from her blocking position by the river, he'd landed next to the Pretty Mary so that his crew wouldn't have far to transport the masts and spars they were commandeering.
Daniel preened himself mentally. He was learning how to set down on dry land without bobbling dangerously on reflected thrust. It wasn't a skill an RCN commander often needed, but someday it might be the difference between life and death.
Tovera stepped out of the main hatch. She looked oddly nondescript, even when carrying a submachine gun slung so that the butt was in her hand beside her right hip.
Tovera saw Daniel and nodded minutely. Two spacers coming back from town carrying a rolled carpet between them stepped sharply to the opposite side of the ramp, careful never to make contact with the servant.
Daniel's face became still. The nod meant that Tovera was bringing him a message that Adele didn't choose to send over the air.
He'd have walked toward the ramp to meet the servant halfway except that the howl of a two-stroke engine racing from the town drew his attention. Hogg had liberated an air-cushion scooter for the duration of his stay on Falassa. It bounced across a canal. Hogg was driving in a beeline toward the Princess Cecile with the little engine punched out. Daniel suspected he'd make better time if he crossed at the culverts instead of driving over the canals simply because he could, but Hogg had a fondness for the direct approach.
A fondness that had rubbed off on his charge, Young Master Daniel. Subtlety had its place, but there were worse tendencies in an RCN officer than the willingness to go straight for the throat of a problem.
Daniel stood where he was, flipping a coin mentally as to which messenger would reach him first. Tovera did, a few seconds before Hogg tried to stop the way he would in a truck and learned that redirected fans don't give nearly the braking effort that tires against a solid surface do. The scooter slid twenty feet past Daniel on a chorus of curses from its driver.
Tovera said with her usual look of cool amusement. said Daniel. He touched the switch on his helmet, cuing it manually rather than using an oral command to engage the intercom. Hogg cried as he leaped off his vehicle. said Tovera without expression.
Daniel looked up at the riggers. he called, using his lungs instead of technology. * * *
Adele felt Daniel's presence behind her and turned. To her surprise, he'd changed into his Dress Whites since she last noticed him. She'd been busy, of course.
Daniel said. Adele said. She got to her feet, feeling a trifle wobbly. She hadn't actually been at her console so very long, but she'd been very focused for the last half hour. The ship was restive though quiet save for the sounds of machinery. The crew was at action stations. Along with all the normal assignments, Dorst had a squad of marksmen in the wardroom ready to join their fire to that of the automatic impeller at the open hatch. If things went wrong.
Daniel said. Adele turned and entered a preset command, using the console's virtual keyboard instead of taking her personal data unit out of its pocket. If she could do it, indeed!&nbsp;
Daniel said. He smiled broadly as Adele fell in beside him on their way from the bridge. Tovera waited at the hatch with Adele's gunbelt; Hogg had gone to join the squad of marksmen.
Adele said. Daniel said, stretching with the care that his uniform's strait limits required. He grinned.
Adele walked down the companionway behind Daniel and with Tovera following her. He glanced back and said, Adele said in the dry tone she used when someone told her to do something obvious. When a Cinnabar aristocrat attends a gathering of barbarians, of course he takes precedence.&nbsp;
She shook her head in self-amusement. She'd thought of herself as an egalitarian when she worked in the Academic Collections on Blythe. There, of course, she'd been surrounded by other well-born intellectuals.
A boarding party with submachine guns and grenades filled Corridor B in both directions from the entryway. Woetjans and Barnes headed the sections.
a spacer called. Woetjans snarled vainly for silence, but the whole party was cheering as Daniel and his companions walked into the sunlight. And perhaps that wasn't such a bad accompaniment after all.
The corvette and the captured freighter were at a corner of the port distant from other vessels. The plain before the Princess Cecile's main hatch had filled with pirates and the vehicles that had brought them to the assembly. There were several thousand of them, a staggering number in comparison to the empty purple wasteland Adele had seen a few hours before.
She sat on the deck, her back against the jamb of the main hatch, and brought her data unit live. At the top of the display Adele put a panorama of the crowd, but her own concerns were with matters that might not take place openly.
Tovera was across the hatchway, scanning the thousands of faces on the ground below. She too had specialized concerns.
Kelburney had parked his armored car at the bottom of the ramp. He stood with his back to the vehicle, behind a line of his bodyguards. On seeing Daniel appear, he started his oration.
The noise of the crowd, most of it drunk or still drinking, completely covered Kelburney's unaided voice. A technician with a desperate expression stuck his head out the rear hatch of the vehicle.
Daniel raised his hands in greeting. his voice boomed. He beckoned Kelburney forward with his left hand. It struck Adele that if the Astrogator hadn't been so determined to avoid informing Daniel of his plans, Daniel wouldn't have chosen to embarrass him in this fashion. The fact that only Kelburney and a few of his closest aides knew what was happening now made the insult bearable but all the deeper.
Kelburney's face went white, then red. Finally he rocked forward in a gust of laughter. Pushing through the line of his startled bodyguards, he strode up the ramp and took his place beside Daniel.
he said in a low voice. He nodded toward Adele.
Adele looked at him. Kelburney wasn't a stupid man, but living in this milieu of drunken pirates had led him to the habit of making stupid boasts.
Kelburney added, in the same whimsical tone.
Daniel clasped him, forearm to forearm. his amplified voice said. Where Adele sat, shielded by the curve of the corvette's hull, Daniel's voice through the speakers on the dorsal ridge was merely loud. In the front rank of the assembly it would be painful, though of course most of those listening had numbed themselves with ethanol.
Kelburney whispered. He faced the assembly, raising his hands as Daniel had done a moment before. Adele nodded to him.
Kelburney thundered. He held out his left arm toward Daniel as though demonstrating a prized possession. Daniel glanced aside toward Adele and mouthed, He could have shouted his joke through the corvette's speakers and still not been heard. The assembly's cheers of agreement had a savage undertone, like the growls of great carnivores expecting to be fed momentarily.
The Astrogator faced Daniel. he said, Daniel said. He and Kelburney were playacting for a group of adults with the simplicity and cruelty of children, but there was nothing in it to raise a smile. Except perhaps a rictus like that which lifted Aretine's lips the last time Adele had seen her. . . .
Kelburney said, shaking his right fist. The cheers of the dispersing pirates were lost in the snarl and whine of their vehicles' engines. They were in motion, swarming toward their cutters, before the last echoes of the Astrogator's voice had died away.
Kelburney looked at Daniel with an expression compounded of admiration and pique. he asked.
Daniel said. Kelburney said. Then he grinned at first Daniel, then Adele, and added, &nbsp;

CHAPTER THIRTY
The sixty-seven Selma cutters plotted on Daniel's display vanished and reappeared, moving toward Strymon in short hops through the Matrix. It was like watching a swarm of locusts leapfrogging one another as they advanced. Though there seemed no organization, the motion was as inexorable as the rising tide.
The four Strymonian frigates orbiting the planet shook out their sails, then slipped into the Matrix themselves rather than contest with a force ten times superior to them. The Princess Cecile was already above the planet, broadcasting her warning to Commodore Pettin's ships below.
said Lt. Mon, who was viewing the same simulation from the Battle Direction Center. Daniel scratched the hair over his left temple where the rim of his cap rode when he was wearing one. For no obvious reason, he tended to itch there when he was in the Matrix.
Daniel said, Mon said. Daniel said. Dorst's voice noted. The midshipman was speaking louder than necessary, a sign of his tension.
Mon said, returning to his immediate duties. Daniel wasn't a dreamer, not really, but he had his reveries. For a moment he let his mind wander to the inevitable RCN punitive expedition that would retake Strymon and put paid to the Alliance interlopers. Would the Princess Cecile be a part of it? And would, for that matter, Lt. Daniel Leary still be in command of the Princess Cecile?
Daniel chuckled, calling up the sail plan, power output, consumption, and all the scores of other displays that were the same as they'd been before he and Mon discussed the attack. With near certainty they'd remain the same until the Princess Cecile returned to sidereal space. Daniel was still better off looking them over once more than he'd be building castles in the fairyland of the future.
Adele had rotated her seat away from the opalescence of her empty screen and was looking across the bridge. She nodded minusculy when Daniel caught her eye; but she hadn't been, he realized, looking at him or at anything else within the starship's limited confines.
Adele was uncomfortable in the Matrix. From the little she'd said, she disliked transitions even more than most of the humans who had to undergo them. She didn't have work to occupy her so she was sending her mind into another place entirely.
Daniel stood and walked over to his friend. He didn't have any duties for the moment either, so using his time to raise the morale of a valuable member of his crew was clearly called for.
Daniel said conversationally. the PA system announced, this time in Mon's voice. The atmosphere of the ship didn't change, but someone on B Level began singing, in a wheezy bass.
Adele focused on Daniel. Her face would never look soft, but some of the edge of tension over her cheekbones eased. she asked; a polite question rather than a matter of personal concern.
Daniel said. He grinned. Adele smiled the way a cat does before biting. she said. Mon announced.
Daniel felt a surge of anticipation. There was nothing in the world like it. The moment that a girl drops her pretense of modesty and coos, wasn't in the same league.
Daniel said with a grin. He squeezed Adele's shoulder and strode back to his console with the economy of a captain who knows every inch and ounce of his ship.
Betts continued obsessively running missile solutions, but Sun turned from the gunnery display and gave Daniel a thumbs-up. Adele had her personal data unit where the console's virtual keyboard would normally be projected. She raised her wands; a ripple ran across the pastel blankness of the display.
Images flipped in Daniel's mind. He saw himself from four angles; a trail of future selves stretched to infinity from each possible existence.
Mon closing in a gasp rather than the intended shout, as though he'd been punched in the stomach while the word was still in his throat.
Strymon, a blue ball with more land than water, hung 13,000 miles below the Princess Cecile. Three frigates were in geosynchronous orbits at 24,000 miles; the calculated position of the fourth put it on the other side of the planet from the corvette.
Daniel shrank the real-time view of Strymon to a sidebar and expanded the Plot Position Indicator from the right half to his whole display. He'd set the PPI's field for 300,000 miles above the planetary center. That was an unusually large volume for the purpose, but it allowed him to view the pirate cutters as they entered sidereal space.
Daniel ordered, using modulated laser beams directed at the three visible ships. The Princess Cecile had exited directly above the capital, Palia, and the harbor serving it. Lt. Mon had the job of contacting the ships of Commodore Pettin's squadron on high-power microwave while Daniel warned off the guardships. Under the circumstances, Daniel didn't think the commodore would object to being left to an underling, though you could never be sure.
The PPI glowed, the pattern shifting like tinsel drifting in still air. Several, then a score, of the pirate cutters had vanished into the Matrix only moments from their first appearance in sidereal space. Now they reappeared, less than half their previous distance from Strymon.
Daniel said. The fourth vessel had edged up from the planet's shadow; the Princess Cecile's commo suite directed a laser emitter at the Strymonian without further input from Daniel or Adele. Precisely how surrender was an honorable option for the picket vessels was a question beyond Daniel's ability to answer, but it seemed a useful phrase to throw in at the moment. His father would've nodded with understanding.
The High Drive whined at maximum output to hold the Princess Cecile in position above Palia. Because the corvette was well below geosynchrony, that meant braking against its initial orbital velocity. Pray heaven that Mon had a clear link to the squadron!
Only a handful of the pirate cutters remained where they'd originally appeared, well out from Strymon. A gaggle of thirty trembled from the Matrix within 40,000 miles of the planet. Though there was nothing seemingly organized about the pirate formation, Daniel noted with delight and amazement that the ships were in precisely the same relative alignment as they had been before they entered the Matrix a few minutes before.
Woetjans and both rigging watches were on the hull, despite the danger and the fact they had no job to do at the moment. Daniel wasn't going to land so there was no need to take the antennas down, but he didn't know&#151;couldn't know&#151;what the corvette's next course might be. The riggers waited in case an emergency required an immediate adjustment to the sails.
Not, after all, an unlikely occurrence under the present circumstances.
Daniel repeated. He'd inset real-time imagery of the frigates across the bottom of his display. The Strymonians orbited with eight antennas partially extended, permitting them to shift into the Matrix on short notice but also able to maneuver in normal space. For the most part they expected to deal with smugglers or merchantmen lifting without paying their port duties, not actual warfare above their homeworld.
Several Selma cutters came out of the Matrix within Strymon's gravity well. None were particularly close to the guardships, though their varying altitudes and orbits meant that the parties could have volleyed rockets at one another if they'd chosen to do so.
Another score of pirates appeared in near space. Daniel shrank the scale of his PPI to a normal hundred thousand miles; if he'd halved the radius again, he'd still contain the entire Selma fleet.
Most of Kelburney's captains could have exited within pistol range of the frigates if they'd chosen to do so. The Strymonians would have fired rockets out of reflex before there was time to parley; and then would have died in salvos from the remaining scores of pirate cutters.
Few captains, no matter how brave, would throw their lives and ships away uselessly against overwhelming force&#151;and those few would be restrained or shot by their own crews if they attempted such general suicide. By showing the Strymonians that resistance was pointless, Daniel was letting them save their lives.
Kelburney had accepted the plan with laughing agreement. Daniel didn't doubt that the pirates would slug it out at knife distance if forced to, but theirs was a business rather than a crusade. Death meant the end of the party and was therefore to be avoided.
said a high-pitched female voice which came to Daniel on a direct link. President Delos Vaughn? Good God, what had been happening on Strymon during the past few days?
Two of the four frigates vanished, their icons from the PPI and the real-time images from the sidebar as well. They'd shaken out sails on their partial rigs and were escaping into the Matrix rather than trust the mercy of the swarming pirate fleet.
Daniel had expected and intended all four of the pickets to flee during the opportunity he'd given them. 127's&#151;surrender? claim of alliance?&#151;was a pleasant surprise, leaving only the fourth&#151;
a male voice buzzed through a poorly modulated laser link. Daniel cued his console to respond to both of the surrendering patrol vessels and also to the Astrogator's flagship. The Princess Cecile wasn't equipped to contact all sixty-seven ships of the pirate armada in a single transmission; he could only hope that Kelburney was.
Daniel said. There was always a risk that some pirate would settle an old grudge by rocketing sitting ducks like the Strymonian frigates, but that wasn't Daniel's major concern at the moment. What happened, happened.
The PPI was alive with cutters circling Strymon, in as many orbits as there were ships. The patterns had the chaotic complexity of a kaleidoscope, seemingly random motion which was nonetheless as precise as a sword dance. Serving alongside the pirates provided memories any captain would cherish. And other memories as well, of course.
Kelburney's own vessel was in the same orbit as the Princess Cecile, braking hard to hold position ten miles astern. Like the rest of the Selma cutters, it stepped a full set of antennas despite the stresses of maneuvering in normal space. The pirates favored shorter, thicker masts than the starships of more traditional states; even so, the Astrogator must be risking his rig in his desire to be able to race off through the Matrix without delay.
Lt. Mon said. As the Princess Cecile struggled to hold position over Palia, it was dropping toward the surface of Strymon. Eventually Daniel was going to have to gain altitude or enter the atmosphere&#151;and he certainly wasn't going to enter the atmosphere. Still, he didn't have to make that decision quite yet.
Daniel said. Adele's body was rigid. Her hands danced like a pair of balletomimes, and her display was a mass of data. It meant no more to Daniel than his astrogation vectors would have meant to her, but so long as Adele was at the signals console he knew he'd have all the warning there could be from that source.
He switched to the squadron command frequency that Mon had used to alert the ships on the ground. he said. Pettin wouldn't have heard Daniel claim to be an admiral to overawe the guardships. With luck&#151;and a Signals Officer who was preternaturally adept at wiping records&#151;he never would learn about that.
Pettin said, his voice beginning to break up in the higher registers. wrong word, junior lieutenants don't tell commodores what they've got to do Daniel said. The command link was dual frequency, with the emitting and receiving antennas at bow and stern respectively. The separation wasn't enough on a vessel as small as a corvette to send and receive simultaneously through an atmosphere without interference, but it did allow Pettin to manifest his fury in a roar of static that silenced Daniel.
the commodore was saying in the enforced silence. Daniel let out his breath in a sigh of relief. Regardless of what happened to the career of Lt. Daniel Oliver Leary afterwards, the Winckelmann and her consorts would be safely out of the Strymon system within the hour. It might be months or even years before circumstances allowed the RCN to reenter the Sack with a force sufficient to deal with the powerful Alliance squadron now based on Tanais, but at least the Cinnabar ships and a thousand trained spacers had avoided massacre.
he said, Commodore Pettin said. The words sounded heartfelt. said Adele over the intercom, * * *
Strymon was a developed world with a highly organized information infrastructure. It occurred to Adele as she viewed clips of the chaos below that she could probably find similar records of the Proscriptions following the Three Circles Conspiracy.
She'd heard her parents had been shot against the wall of the garden behind their townhouse. Adele hadn't been an outdoors child, but her room was at the back of the house. She had familiar memories of ivy growing against the sun-bleached red bricks.
said Adele, using a two-party link to the command console. Adele brought up imagery of citizens wearing bright Strymonian costumes marching up three avenues to the square on which the Cinnabar Residence stood, one of several ornate buildings behind walled forecourts. The pavement was plasticized clay, seamless and unable to provide missiles, but the leaders of the mob had thoughtfully provided themselves with sacks of fist-sized stones.
Daniel wondered aloud. Two uniformed police at the entrance ambled away as the mob approached. One of them even tipped his cap to a woman in the front rank.
Adele said. Daniel said quietly.
Four chattering women came out a side door of the residence and started down the street. They were members of the housekeeping staff, Adele knew from the records of the incident. All were born on Strymon, though they came from country districts rather than Palia itself.
They saw the oncoming mob, hesitated, and tried to get back through the door by which they'd left the building. It had locked behind them. The women started running in the opposite direction, only to meet another limb of the mob.
Stones flew from both directions. The women hunched, trying to protect their heads with their arms. Members of the mob knocked them down with clubs, then finished the job with boots.
Adele said without expression. Daniel sighed audibly. he said. Adele said, She called up a montage of images, some from news media and others gathered from the conspirators' own files. Though the mercenaries had been hired as individuals on a dozen different worlds, they were outfitted with battledress of a standard pattern bearing the badge and shoulder patches of the Land Forces of the Republic, Cinnabar's army. They carried stocked impellers and submachine guns of Cinnabar manufacture, with a limited number of crew-served weapons.
One of the images showed Delos Vaughn addressing a crowd of civilians. The sound bite attached to the clip rang, Adele said. She shook her head in disgust and amazement. The Princess Cecile was maneuvering constantly to optimize its position above Strymon. Neither the changing vectors nor the whine of the antimatter engines disturbed Adele now that she had real work to do.
Daniel asked. Adele said. She'd searched for army deployments, found none, and finally worked back from clips of the fighting to learn what the government troops were called so that she could determine their strength. Daniel said. Adele selected an image: government troops with violet collar flashes arriving in twenty-place aircars on the outskirts of a village. They began to advance down the main street, still mounted on the vehicles which flew low, using ground effect for support.
A podium with a dozen chairs, many of them knocked over when the speakers hastily fled, had been erected in the town square. As the lead vehicle approached, a man in the clock tower opened fire with an impeller. Slugs punched through the aircar's aluminum body and sparkled off the cobblestone pavement.
More guns fired from basement windows; the houses were frame with wooden shingles, but they had stone foundations. Troops on the vehicles returned fire wildly, occasionally dropping their fellows with ricochets. Civilians flung roof tiles to shatter on vehicles and the pavement.
The aircars turned and raced back the way they'd come, still hugging the ground. One of the buildings was beginning to burn. A civilian's body lay in the street, and half the troops in the back of the last vehicle out were sprawled or writhing in smears of blood.
Adele said. Daniel said. Adele's lips tightened, but that was a precise description of Chastelaine's probable attitude. That it was also very likely Daniel's own attitude was inconsequential for the time being.
she resumed, The Winckelmann dropped majestically toward the bay around which Palia was built. A merchant ship was lifting at the same time. Many of the vessels which had been in the harbor at the start of the riots had already left.
Daniel said. It must have been going through his mind as it was Adele's that while the remainder of the squadron was settling peacefully onto Strymon, the Princess Cecile had been raked by the Tanais defenses.
Adele said. Daniel mused. Adele said, though part of her wondered why she was bothering to make excuses for the commodore. She wasn't the one to judge the military reasons that had put the whole Cinnabar force on the surface, but it wouldn't have taken information-gathering skills nearly as sophisticated as her own to warn Pettin that more was going on than the Observer realized.
Daniel said. He was stating his analysis rather than asking a question. Adele said, Adele pursed her lips, then said, said Daniel. Adele said, struggling to understand a situation devoid of logic. Daniel said. Adele said. Lt. Mon said. He'd broken in on a dedicated link from the Battle Direction Center to Daniel's command console. It didn't pass through the signals console, but Adele had set the system to echo everything to her unit regardless of provenance. There was no information that she might not need, some time, some where.
Daniel said. Adele had called up the message and was running the speech attributed to Vaughn through voice recognition software when Daniel said, she said. &nbsp;

CHAPTER THIRTY-ONE
The Achilles looked to be a dumpy little vessel at present because her rig was stowed. Even when fully telescoped, the masts of the first and last of her four rings stuck out beyond the yacht's short hull. Extended and wearing a full suit of sails, those masts would give her an area-to-mass ratio equalled by few if any other ships of Daniel's acquaintance. To him, that was a mark of great beauty.
The scale of the image was too small to show the boarding line connecting the yacht to the Princess Cecile, though Daniel could have directed the console to emphasize it if he'd had any reason to. Vaughn had asked to board via a tube and to bring several of his aides with him. Daniel had granted neither request.
The outer airlock dogged home; a moment later the inner valve opened. Woetjans, her faceshield flung open, half dragged, half guided, Delos Vaughn into Corridor C. Vaughn's expression through the synthetic sapphire of his visor was both irritated and frightened.
Daniel glanced again at the image of the Achilles. To Adele across the bridge he said, Adele shrugged. she said. With the bosun's help, Vaughn was struggling out of a rigging suit meant for someone a size larger, shooting frustrated looks toward her and Daniel but for the moment unable to join them. There was too much ambient noise for him to overhear. said Daniel, Vaughn kicked out of the suit's right leg and stepped to the hatchway. he said in a clear voice.
Daniel said. Then, because he didn't want to seem petty, he corrected himself: Vaughn said with his familiar engaging smile as he strode forward. Sun looked over his shoulder, then went back to his display; Betts never paused in obsessively computing missile courses. Adele continued to listen to the snips of intership and surface communications which her software culled out for her, but her eyes and her primary attention were on Delos Vaughn.
Daniel said. Facing Vaughn, he found it hard to be sure of how he felt about the man. Not hatred, certainly, nor even anger. There was a sort of admiration, Daniel had to admit, for a person who was so pure an example of the thing he was; and disgust as well, at what that thing was.
Vaughn said, bluffly disarming. Tovera watched from just inside the captain's suite; her right hand rested lightly on the grip of her submachine gun. Hogg was in the bridge hatchway, toying with a loop of fishing line and grinning.
Daniel said quietly. said Vaughn; and he did, the tightness around his nostrils showed that clearly. Daniel said. Vaughn's smile was crystal hard. he said, Sun rose from his console in a fluid movement. His face was red. Adele grabbed his wrist. Sun jerked loose, but Hogg now stood between the spacer and Vaughn, and Tovera was behind him with her gun's muzzle a millimeter from his spine.
Everyone was looking at Daniel. he said mildly. Vaughn was a brave man to have boarded the Princess Cecile now. Despite that, he wasn't a fool, so he must need Daniel's help very badly.
Adele said. Her left hand came out of her pocket; Sun was at his console again and the two servants had backed off the bridge.
she continued, her eyes on something far distant in time, She looked at Daniel, then at Vaughn. She added, Vaughn swallowed. He said, Adele looked at Daniel sharply. He nodded. Vaughn knew his rivals had plotted with the Alliance, but he didn't realize that Admiral Chastelaine had reached the Strymon system.
he said, Adele said. She'd rotated her seat to face her console again. Vaughn's mouth opened, probably to protest. He was suddenly between Hogg and Tovera, backing quickly to the hatchway. Woetjans and the riggers with her in the corridor watched in amusement, but they didn't get involved where they would so clearly be superfluous.
said the Astrogator's voice. Daniel glanced at the Plot Position Indicator. The pirate cutters were beginning to vanish like dewdrops in the sunlight. Captain Strete had brought word through the Matrix to his fellows, then fled only moments ahead of them. Daniel really couldn't blame the Selmans; not that it would have mattered if he had.
He hit the alarm button. he ordered. The Winckelmann's plasma thrusters covered the RF frequency with thunderous white noise, but the laser communicator should punch through the exhaust iridescence clearly enough to get the point across. Another hour would have been enough; but the RCN didn't depend on luck or prayer, either one.
Daniel said. He cleared his throat and continued, * * *
Somewhere behind Adele, Delos Vaughn squealed briefly. She'd guess that Hogg was trussing and gagging the president rather than cutting his throat. Hogg being Hogg, you couldn't be sure; nor was it a question about which she could raise much concern.
Both Strymonian frigates were sending increasingly shrill questions toward the Princess Cecile as they watched the pirate cutters disappear into the Matrix. The Achilles's captain sounded querulous also, but since the yacht was unarmed&#151;Adele had looked up the registry description&#151;that wasn't a matter for present concern.
The patrol vessels were. Daniel and the officers in the Battle Direction Center were concerned with the ship and Commodore Pettin; but Adele was the signals officer, after all.
she said, using microwave because Daniel was on the modulated laser. Were you supposed to say if you were claiming to be a flagship? She'd ask when there was leisure, so she'd know the next time the question arose. For now, the terrified babbling of the Strymonian officers was sufficient.
Daniel was saying, The corvette shivered as hydraulic jacks extended the antennas and spread the sails. For a moment Adele heard clang-clang, clang-clang. Riggers on the hull were freeing a jammed tube with their mauls.
a voice replied on a laser beam from the Winckelmann. Despite the initial tight focus and the voice sharpening provided by the Princess Cecile's communications suite, static roared through the commodore's words. Adele glanced at the image of Daniel inset at the top of her screen. His fingers hammered at his virtual keyboard while his eyes flicked back and forth at the data appearing on the display before him. Daniel was a sure and reasonably fast typist, but he put as much effort into his keystrokes as he would in splitting logs.
Pettin continued. Midshipman Vesey's voice warned over the PA system. The signal lights pulsed.
Daniel said. His fingers and eyes continued to move as though controlled by an entity outside the person who responded to Commodore Pettin. He broke the connection. The eyes of his image met Adele's.
she said. Daniel said, calling across the noisy bridge so that the other officers could hear as well. Vesey said, and Adele's world everted itself in what was becoming a familiar fashion.
* * *
Daniel said, He stood, feeling the Princess Cecile heel through the soles of his feet. The ship was a living apex of the infinite directions and forces of the Matrix. Adele turned from her console and said in a tone of inward-directed anger, Daniel said. he added. He tried to sound solemn, but he didn't manage very well. Betts said, looking over his shoulder as Daniel followed Adele toward the suit locker. Daniel said. Tovera and Hogg were in the corridor, readying Adele's rigging suit. Hogg's face was a thundercloud; Tovera seemed, as usual, mildly amused. Hogg snarled to Daniel, his face turned aside as he lifted Adele without ceremony for Tovera to pull on the legs of the suit. Daniel said quietly as he donned his suit in a practiced reflex: legs, arms, and then close the plastron; three simple movements that he could do in the dark or so hungover that he could scarcely stand. He cleared his throat and added, Hogg said. He squeezed the rigid shoulder of Daniel's suit before turning away again. He muttered, Daniel said. He gestured Adele into the airlock, then stepped through and dogged the hatch.
Daniel started to clamp Adele's helmet for her. She raised her hand. she said. Daniel shrugged and pursed his lips. There was no reason she shouldn't know, after all.
he said. Adele gave him an odd smile. she said. Daniel chuckled. He closed her helmet, closed his&#151;ordinarily a pair of spacers going topside would check each other's fittings, but that wasn't going to work here&#151;and opened the outer hatch onto the hull.
Daniel paused a step from the coaming. As always, the beauty of the Matrix brought a lump to his throat.
The Princess Cecile trembled through veils of light more delicate than spiderweb, bathed in colors that had no name in the world of landsmen, and formed patterns that reproduced themselves all the way to an infinity not of one universe but all universes. Daniel Oliver Leary was a part of this splendor!
He handed Adele onto the hull and touched helmets with her. He said, Daniel felt her suit stir against his; she'd probably shrugged. she said. Ah, well; she found an excitement in databases that seemed likely to continue eluding him.
Daniel hooked Adele's safety line to a staple, then closed the hatch behind them. The Princess Cecile's twenty-four masts were at their full extension; topsails shimmered on all of them, and the huge lower courses were set on the dorsals as well.
He and Adele stood silent&#151;he entranced, she . . . well, polite and docile might be the correct description of her feelings, but in the shrouded anonymity of the suits he could at least imagine that some of the wonder reached her below the level of awareness. The riggers were scarcely noticeable even when they were in direct view. The sails were huge and alive with the energy of the cosmos pressing them, while the humans who walked the yards to make final adjustments in the spread and lay were mere shadows against the effulgence.
The mainsails on rings C and D shifted clockwise. The Princess Cecile trembled, then sank from one bubble universe to another. The astrogation computer had chosen the latter's physical constants as most suitable for this stage of the voyage. To Daniel it was as if the heart of a sun had opened momentarily, blinding in its beauty.
Whatever Adele felt or saw caused her to snatch at him so violently that her boots lost their magnetic grip on the hull. Daniel's arm encircled her and guided her back to firm footing.
Daniel said. Daniel cleared his throat, lifting his helmet away from Adele's momentarily so that the sound wouldn't pass. he went on. He frowned, thinking about the way Adele had tried to describe the sensation of Casimir radiation on human retinas as gray or pastel. was a word whose normal meaning had nothing to do with the interplay of forces between the universes; but Daniel had no better word, so he used what there was to give false meaning to a concept that even many astrogators wouldn't have understood. There were things that you could only explain to someone who already knew.
Daniel went on with a sigh. The topsails of E Ring furled forty percent. On Dorsal, the sail fluttered but jammed well short of the programmed amount. Daniel took a step forward&#151;and caught himself, feeling silly, because with both watches on duty there was someone at the antenna already.
He watched the rigger climb stays hand over hand, throw a leg over the yard, and then kick the parrel with his other foot. The sail's taut fabric fluttered loose, then drew tight again as the jack hauled it into position.
Daniel whispered. Adele said, all expression squeezed out of her voice by the helmet-to-helmet contact. By reflex Daniel opened his mouth to say, but that wasn't the right response for a friend.
he said. He stepped slightly apart to stare at the Matrix between the sails of the corvette's A and B rings. All time and space danced in that shimmering wonder.
Helmet to helmet again with Adele but speaking as much to himself, Daniel said, Adele said with the understated precision that was even more a part of her than the personal data unit.
Daniel laughed and hugged her through the rigid bracing of their suits. he said. * * *
Lt. Mon came up Corridor C from the Battle Direction Center, moving like an angry boxer. Somebody called to him from a compartment&#151;Hoagland, the technician who was going over the Medic again before it might have to be used. Mon ignored him and glared at Adele when she looked up to watch his approach.
Mon said loudly. He didn't use his knuckles but slapped the hatch flange twice with his fingertips to make it ring.
Daniel said, muting his holographic display to only a shimmer like dust motes between him and Mon. Daniel's face showed very little, but to Adele he appeared as puzzled about what Mon was doing here as she was herself.
Mon said. Even Betts turned briefly from his console before going back to his fantasy of missile tracks. Mon thrust his hand through the display area of the command console. Daniel leaned forward and lifted slightly from his seat to clasp arms with his second in command.
he said. A familiar smile lit his eyes and made the right corner of his mouth quirk upward. Mon looked blank, then guffawed. He slapped his left hand over Daniel's right, sandwiching it against his biceps muscle, then unclasped and stepped away.
Mon said. He turned and strode back the way he'd come; an angry little man who always saw the worst in a situation and who never did less than his duty. Adele felt a surge of, well, friendship for him.
Daniel started to bring up his display, then grinned more broadly at Adele and activated the PA system instead. he said. the ship answered. Unaided voices, several shouting on the intercom, and Midshipman Dorst using the PA system itself from the Battle Direction Center.
Everyone aboard the Princess Cecile was cheering. Illiterate engine-wipers, women whose families had been RCN for every generation in living memory, men whose idea of patriotism was that anyone not from Cinnabar was a wog with no honor and no rights.
All those people cheered; and so did Mistress Adele Mundy, the scion of Chatsworth, a woman whose culture was as broad and deep as all human history.
Lt. Mon, returned to the Battle Direction Center, announced, &nbsp;

CHAPTER THIRTY-TWO
Transition. Daniel's display came live with imagery; he adjusted the scale so that the edge of the frame encompassed without waste volume the Alliance squadron forming above the huge disk of Getica. In Daniel's present state, the discomfort of being slowly disemboweled wouldn't have prevented him from functioning.
he said, personally decreasing the charge levels of the Princess Cecile's current set of thirty-six sails. In Daniel's mind, negative images of the bridge and his companions were projected in infinite series and through a nongeometric dimension.
Mon, the midshipmen, and an artificial intelligence within the astrogation computer were all working on an attack solution. If Daniel dropped dead in the next ten minutes or so, perhaps one of those courses would be chosen. Otherwise, Lt. Daniel Leary would be trusting his own instincts with only the barest regard for other opinions. A warship wasn't a democracy, and a captain who didn't lead was a fool and a disaster for those whom he commanded.
A red-lit sidebar appeared at the top of his display. He glanced at it in furious annoyance, thinking, What a bloody time for the screen to malfunction&#151;&nbsp;
And noticed to his amazement that the six tiny images there were the ships of the Alliance squadron, rotating to show what appeared to be their current sail plans rather than the maximum theoretical rig. Optical data gathered at three light-seconds distance wasn't good enough to provide such detail.
Daniel enlarged the images, looking through the haze of coherent light toward Adele. Through the intercom her voice said, Daniel said. He felt an odd elation. He'd expected to die in the next few minutes . . . and it might still happen, of course; there were no guarantees in life. But now that Daniel knew the angles from which the battleship's secondary batteries would be screened by the expanse of her sails, he would give his command opportunities for survival that couldn't be expected from pure chance.
Oh, yes. The sail plans helped.
Daniel said, cuing the message to Betts, Sun, and the Battle Direction Center; and Adele of course, but not by his determination. Betts nodded without looking away from his console and continued working. Sun looked around in amazement, however. Sun had been a rigger in the merchant service before enlisting in the RCN and finding a new focus in gunnery. He knew, though not as well as Daniel himself, how difficult it was to navigate through the Matrix with that degree of precision.
The Princess Cecile shifted again between universes. A vessel couldn't remain at rest within the Matrix, so to hold position it moved from one bubble to another, balancing flow against time to return to its original position.
The Alliance squadron had almost certainly noticed the Princess Cecile's brief return to normal space. A merchant vessel wouldn't have been able to transition so quickly, so even though Daniel had turned off the corvette's identification transponder Admiral Chastelaine would know that a warship had spotted his ships.
Whose warship remained an open question: Strymonian frigate, Selma pirate, or just possibly an RCN ship like the one which the Tanais defenses had mauled or destroyed a week previous? Chastelaine would pause to make sure his ships were in full fighting trim before he set off for Strymon to put down the rebellion there.
Daniel grinned as he started a new set of course calculations. The Alliance admiral wasn't the only one wondering about the future.
Tovera stood at the wardroom hatch, looking in all directions without appearing either nervous or furtive. She and Hogg must have moved Delos Vaughn from the suit locker to there. Knowing Hogg, Vaughn was trussed to the clamps that held the table legs during meals.
Daniel smiled as he calculated potentials&#151;on the astrogation display, not the attack screen. If he'd had time, he'd have had to order a more polite form of confinement for their guest and ally. Fortunately, Daniel was very busy.
Maroon a Leary of Bantry in the desert, would he?&nbsp;
The attack involved three aspects of the Princess Cecile's course: velocity, vector, and location in sidereal space. Velocity was a mere mathematical conversion of force applied through the physical constants of the universes which the corvette had traversed after entry to the Matrix. Vector was more difficult, the real business of astrogation; but there were thousands of astrogators who could achieve an approximation that would be adequate to the needs of the present attack.
Absolute location, though . . . that went beyond science, perhaps beyond art. It required that the astrogator&#151;that Daniel&#151;read the Matrix from topside and keep it in the back of his mind as he viewed the gauges on his display.
The weight of Casimir radiation affected the potential of the sails resisting it to thrust the Princess Cecile through the Matrix. There were ongoing efforts to develop software which could chart deviations from the calculated mean and adjust the sails to take maximum benefit from the actual conditions. All the programs to date had failed: they overcorrected, inducing a pyramid of errors into the system until the computer had to shut down for reprogramming.
A human being who'd seen the flow of universes beyond the sails and who felt each stress, each charge, of the ship he captained could hope to do what no electronic mind could encompass. It was no more than a hope, of course; but for the crew of a corvette preparing to attack a battleship, hope was an unusual boon.
Daniel ordered. Dorst began to say.
Mon said before Daniel could offer his equivalent of the same thought. Knowing Mon, if Dorst was within reach at the time he started his excuse there'd been a slap as punctuation.
If that'd happened, Daniel hoped Dorst would have better sense than to resent it. The midshipman was big, young, and healthy, but Mon was too experienced a veteran to fight fair. He'd literally mop the deck with Dorst's face after kicking him in the balls a few times to induce the proper frame of mind.
There were things you learned in the Academy, and there were things you learned from the Mons and Woetjans and Hoggs of this world. You needed both to be a credit to the RCN.
Lt. Daniel Leary wore a smile as he viewed the solutions of Mon, Vesey, the computer, and Dorst's own partial. The last was a good start, but the boy had to learn that sometimes having the answer right was less important than having the answer now.
The computer's course would require fourteen hours in the Matrix and two intermediate returns to normal space to fix the corvette's location. No other procedure could achieve the required accuracy parameters.
Vesey had done something quite original, plotting back from the target. It wouldn't work in the real world because the small change in the Princess Cecile's course during the plotting couldn't be factored in; the whole solution had to be recalculated. Despite that, it was an intelligent attempt to deal with requirements that one of the most advanced computers in the human universe found beyond practical resolution.
Mon's solution was practical and practically suicidal: wham, bam! Thank you, Admiral Chastelaine. Following exit, the Princess Cecile would have to reenter the Matrix within thirty-one seconds to avoid plunging into Getica's upper atmosphere. Daniel wasn't sure so quick a transition was possible, and he knew it wasn't possible if they received battle damage during the run-in.
Which left Daniel's own solution, the one he'd probably have chosen even if he'd had Admiral bloody Anston as well as Commander Foulkes, the Academy's instructor in tactics, in the BDC sweating over their alternatives. Lt. Daniel Leary commanded this vessel.
Daniel chuckled as he entered the chosen course into the active file. The schematic of the corvette's sails changed; potentials fluttered, spiking before dropping to zero as the Princess Cecile slid dimensionally sideways into another universe. The set of the sails immediately began to change for the second of the three legs of the approach.
Daniel said. His voice sounded vaguely bored when he heard it over the PA system. He and Adele&#151;she under protest&#151;were still wearing their rigging suits. Sun had slipped on his emergency suit of thin fabric while Daniel was topside. Betts, looking at his display with anguish for the perfect solution he still couldn't find, stood. He jerked open the drawer in the chair seat and pulled out his.
Tovera had disappeared into the wardroom. There were emergency suits there, so she and Hogg&#151;
Almighty God, what about Delos Vaughn?
Daniel said. The servants and their prisoner were probably the only ones present in the compartment, but Daniel needed to get the message to anyone who could possibly help. The Princess Cecile made another transition, this the one that brought her onto the long final approach. On Daniel's display the sail schematic changed again.
The topsail of Ventral 6 rotated to 238 degrees instead of the programmed 257 degrees; abruptly it leaped another five degrees, then warped around the remainder of the way in tiny jerks. Daniel thought of riggers ignoring the transition and hauling around by main force the frozen tackle.
The rig was aligned. Daniel checked the schematic again, then fed to the sails the charges that would cause them to react against the pressure of Casimir radiation. The Princess Cecile canted in space-time.
Daniel pressed a dedicated signal button on his console: ALL PERSONNEL WITHIN THE HULL. The six arms of every semaphore station on the hull now stuck out like the petals of a daisy, a clear sign to the riggers that they were to come in immediately. Those who couldn't see a station themselves would be warned by hand-signals from their fellows, but veterans like the Princess Cecile's crew knew without being told that the corvette was making her attack run.
Dorst announced in a firm, normal-sounding voice. Daniel would be able to praise the lad to his grandfather without hesitation. Both midshipmen were assets to the Princess Cecile's crew.
The riggers weren't coming in.
Daniel cleared the semaphore control, then hammered it with his fist. That was waste effort, he knew, but he had to do it anyway.
he said desperately. If there was, he could send a man out&#151;could go himself, he was wearing a rigging suit&#151;and bring the crew down with hand-signals.
Adele brought up a display, checked it, and quickly checked it against three columns of similar data&#151;the recorded values from past occasions when the semaphores were known to be working properly. He'd known there wouldn't be anything wrong.
she said without inflexion. Daniel said. He felt a sudden despair, though he knew he'd have done the same thing if he'd been the Sissie's bosun. The survivors would be ready.
said Lt. Mon. Transition.
* * *
The first missile released with a thump so quick that Adele thought it was part of the buffeting of the corvette's return to sidereal space. The second, launched five seconds later so that it wouldn't be damaged by the exhaust trail of the first, corrected her misapprehension.
Not that Adele cared. She was in the sea of information which flooded from the ships of the Alliance squadron and Tanais Base. Admiral Chastelaine was organizing his force and simultaneously trying to learn what the Strymonian base personnel knew about the recently sighted warship.
Reading between the lines of the queries, Chastelaine didn't trust his new allies even though he'd left a force of Alliance personnel both on Tanais and in the orbital forts defending the base. She smiled grimly. The only certainty with traitors was that they'd stab you in the back also if they found it expedient.
somebody screamed over the PA system.
Adele flicked her left wand, a hair's breadth from cutting access to the idiot who'd misused the system for babble at a time of crisis. She saw for the first time the image echoed from Daniel's screen to the top of her display.
It was still a misuse of the PA system, but this time she'd let it pass. She stared transfixed at the image.
Der Grosser Karl's mass hid all but an edge of Tanais because the corvette viewed her at such close vantage. Adele had seen the Aristotle from closer yet, but that had been in dry dock with the Aristotle's sails removed and her antennas folded against the hull. The bulk of Der Grosser Karl's seventy thousand deadweight tonnes was increased by fully extended eighty-meter antennas and enough hectares of electroconductive sails that a small city could hide beneath them.
Dorst was announcing.
Working forward along the battleship's hull, a topsail, a midsail, and last the mainsail of three successive antennas bulged against their original stress and tore. Sparks of antimatter exhaust danced through them, devouring more of the fabric. The missile had grazed Der Grosser Karl, but without seriously affecting the target's ability to sail and fight.
Dorst said.
The maincourse of an antenna near the battleship's stern vanished in a rainbow fireball. The second missile, Adele thought, but then two more sails, amidships to port and starboard, ruptured. The battleship's plasma cannon were clearing their own fields of fire, blasting away rigging that had been in the way. The Princess Cecile jolted sideways in a bath of flame. A deep, three-hundred-foot-long gouge opened along Der Grosser Karl's bow in a roostertail of coruscance. Red, yellow, and white sparks erupted into vacuum. Metal burned where sufficient air escaped to support combustion; otherwise it merely radiated away the frictional heat that had ripped it apart.
Alliance ships were signaling wildly. Adele noticed with a grim smile that two destroyers were sending in clear and that the heavy cruiser's messages were encrypted according to two separate systems&#151;apparently depending on whether they originated on the bridge or in the Battle Direction Center. She was quite certain that the Alliance vessels were having more trouble understanding their own communications than she was.
a voice said, Daniel's. Adele cut in an image of his face, set and a little redder than usual. The recalculation to adjust for loss of sail area to the battleship's plasma bolt must have been a strain both mental and&#151;as Adele well knew&#151;physical in the need for absolute precision in typing in the commands that alone could save the corvette.
Der Grosser Karl fired another rippling volley, but the missile's grazing impact and damage to several High Drive nozzles caused the great ship to slew. The bolts missed the Princess Cecile. An antenna in the battleship's sternmost ring exploded, the uppermost ten meters shooting off as a projectile driven on a shockwave of the portion vaporized by plasma.
Transition.
People were shouting, perhaps everyone aboard the corvette except Adele herself. She sorted the data her equipment had gathered during the Princess Cecile's seconds within normal space.
Most were ordinary communications, the ash and trash of the Alliance squadron leaving port for the first time after a difficult voyage, but there was also the series of messages dealing with the briefly spotted unknown warship. Then, like shouts of in a crowded theater, came the disbelieving reactions to the corvette's reappearance in the middle of the squadron&#151;
And nothing, because the Princess Cecile was again within the Matrix, safe from attack and probably beyond pursuit by those aboard the Alliance ships. They weren't Selma pirates.
Adele gave a snort of laughter. They weren't Daniel Leary, either.
The alarm that had been pulsing cut off. Lt. Mon said on a dedicated channel between the Battle Direction Center and the bridge, Daniel said as he typed, his strokes as hard and exact as a hammer driving nails. Hogg said, not shouting but speaking loudly enough to be heard over the sounds of a ship at war. Missiles rumbled on their loading tracks, making the whole vessel vibrate. The remaining rounds in the magazine added their thunder as well, each rolling into the space vacated by the one ahead of it.
Daniel said. His voice sounded like wind roaring through a long tube. Hogg said. He turned to watch Mon coming up Corridor C, dressed in a rigging suit. Sun stared without expression at the servant's back as he went to join the lieutenant. He felt Adele's glance, nodded, and forced a smile to her. he said. Adele looked at her friend. She didn't remember ever having seen Daniel so bleak. It was as though she were again staring up the bores of the Aristotle's great plasma cannon in Harbor Three.
She hand-cued the intercom and said, Daniel's face changed in a way she couldn't have described even though she watched as it happened. The planes of muscle over bone fractured into minuscule slivers, then reformed into the smiling young man she'd known&#151;for months only, but the most important months of her life.
he said. As he spoke, the Princess Cecile trembled between universes. Within the bubble of space-time formed by the ship's electric charge, nothing palpable changed; but the pressure of the universe beyond was different.
Adele asked. They shifted again. The first three stages must be intended simply to align the corvette with its target. Adele no longer noticed the feeling of her body falling into four separate infinities.
Daniel smiled again, though there was a rueful quality to it this time. he said. &nbsp;

CHAPTER THIRTY-THREE
Daniel whistled as he computed tracks for the eighteen missiles remaining aboard the Princess Cecile. It was quite a cheerful tune, though the words were another matter. That was true of a lot of catchy songs, come to think.
When the women all heard that King Brady was dead&#151;&nbsp;
The Princess Cecile would pass through the Alliance squadron at high velocity. That wouldn't affect the plasma cannon, of course, except to minimize the corvette's exposure to the bolts, but it did mean that Alliance missiles would have a long time catching up even at twelve-gee accelerations.
They went back home and they dressed in red.&nbsp;
The converse was that the Sissie's own missiles, save for the pair already loaded in the tubes, would be fighting a great deal of negative inertia as they struggled back toward their target. Der Grosser Karl would be able to avoid them easily.
All Daniel's missiles were aimed at the battleship: if Der Grosser Karl were damaged, the powerful remainder of the squadron would be more concerned with defending the cripple than in chasing down Commodore Pettin's force. A big of course.
They come slippin' and aslidin' up and down the street&#151;&nbsp;
Light flickered as the Princess Cecile shifted onto the final leg of her approach. Daniel's course calculation had taken fifteen minutes, three times as long as so short a voyage would require, because he'd added a fourth parameter to the mix.
Usually an attack was made with a minimum of rig aloft so that the vessel could maneuver on High Drive without damaging its antennas. This time Daniel wanted every possible&#151;every surviving&#151;mast raised to its full height and all sails spread. That was a strikingly inefficient way to navigate the Matrix; but in a portion of normal space bathed with the point-blank output of eight-inch plasma cannon, it was the corvette's only hope of survival.
In their old Mother Hubbards and their stocking feet!&nbsp;
Daniel paused in his calculations&#151;for rounds fifteen and sixteen, and if the Sissie survived to launch them she and her crew would be very fortunate indeed&#151;to watch the sail schematic change to reflect the new rig. Starboard Three and Four didn't budge at the thrust of the jacks. Though undamaged at the quick glance which alone was possible after the initial attack, a splash of plasma had welded their base hinges.
Woetjans must have expected that, because at least six mauls slammed rhythmically into the masts within seconds of the jam. Both began to lift. S3 continued normally, but the pump pressure driving S4 flatlined when the antenna had only elevated a few degrees. A hydraulic line&#151;scored by plasma, fractured by an injudicious hammerblow, or simply filled with the cussed determination of machines to fail&#151;had broken.
Brady, Brady, Brady, don't you know you done wrong?&nbsp;
The mast resumed its rise, again within seconds of the initial failure. The bosun must already have rigged tackle to blocks at the head of adjacent, previously extended, masts.
Daniel felt a rush of affection. By God! he wasn't going to let Woetjans throw her life away. Not even if saving her required a sincerely offered threat to blow her head off if she didn't obey.
Antenna Starboard 4 locked into place and, without further hesitation, unfurled its suit of sails. The Princess Cecile was wearing nearly eighty percent of her rig, an unusual event made more remarkable by the battle damage that alone prevented the figure being even higher.
Atoms stripped of electrons and accelerated by repulsion up the bore of a plasma cannon had velocities little short of light speed, but negligible mass. Their ravening touch would destroy the first layer of any matter they collided with, but they wouldn't penetrate. Damage beyond the target's outer layer was a result of transmitted impact&#151;which in the case of sail fabric was almost zero.
After the battleship's initial volley had removed the sails, further bolts would scour the hull. At point-blank range, fluxes intended to change the course of missiles approaching at .6 C would make short work of a corvette.
You bust into my bar when the game was on . . .&nbsp;
The astrogation computer changed the sails' potentials as programmed; Daniel checked the results against the plan and his instinct. All was well.
He grinned. If that was the phrase to use under the circumstances.
Dorst said.
The riggers, their job completed, were clanging back within the Sissie's hull. The inner airlock opened outside the bridge. One figure stepped through, Lt. Mon lifting off the helmet of his rigging suit. He closed the hatch behind him.
You sprung my latch and you broke my door . . .&nbsp;
Catching Daniel's eye, Mon shouted, Daniel thought of his short, dumpy servant and the rangy bosun. Under the circumstances the two were an ideal pair: they understood one another perfectly. Missed communications had killed more people than ever malice dreamed of doing.
Adele said. She'd waited until she saw his attention drawn away from the calculations on his display. Daniel opened a window in his holographic display so that he could meet Adele's eyes without a fog of light between them. She looked worried, concerned about having overstepped her proper authority.
