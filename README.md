Asgard OpenGL/ES Portable Game Engine

A simple game engine written in C circa 2008, intended to natively build and run on Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS and Android.

Utilized the core components to build a few other applications, including:
* a log parser for World of Warcraft to build statistical summaries
* a high-speed in-memory search engine which stores and indexes JSON objects, somewhat comparible to Redis, but specialized for search
